I’m a big Donnie Jean Hudkins fan. Both as an artist and a person. (This piece is much more dark and edgy than what she normally draws. I couldn’t resist it.)

Donnie Jean went to jail yesterday. It doesn’t say what she’s charged with. Probably drug possession. It’s what most homeless people get charged with. 

Making people feel worse about themselves than they already do while also making their lives more difficult with added felonies (all these possession charges are felonies) because society has a moral problem with the way someone chooses to live their own life is maddening. 

On the other hand, sometimes a break away from the street and the drugs gives a person the chance to reassess their life. Sometimes spending a little time in jail can be just what a person needs to decide to go in another direction. 

Honestly, jail and Jesus seem to be some of the biggest motivators to turn your life around, that I’ve seen. 

But 9 times out of 10, the street just pulls these people back in. Even if they get out of jail with the idea that they are going to change their lives, it usually doesn’t last long. The street usually just sucks you back in. 

Donnie Jean loves her street family. I think she, overall, enjoys the lifestyle in general. She was so happy in her little tiny house that we had for her. That, of course, was taken from her by the city. It’s hard for me to see her living another way. 

I keep coming back to the lessons not learned from that book so many people swear is written by God himself. 

Mary Magdalene. Does anyone remember that story? Did Jesus tell us to scorn, judge and jail her? I don’t think that’s how I read it. But yet the biggest trumpeters of the Bible will want just that for Donnie Jean. Somehow the “literal” stories of the Bible don’t literally mean to follow that direction of love and compassion. 

Donnie Jean doesn’t hurt anyone. If anything she is a warm presence for a community that is suffering greatly. 

I love you Donnie Jean.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
