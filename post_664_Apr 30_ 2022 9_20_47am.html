            <div class="_2pin"><div>I think I'm a fan of removing the requirement for needing a permit to carry a concealed gun that is coming to Ohio in June. It gives low income people access to this ability. They still have to pass the background check. <br/> <br/> THAT SAID, I believe a lot of people deeply misunderstand what "stand your ground" means. <br/> <br/> The goal of self-defense is to break contact, and when it can be done safely, “retreating,” for lack of a better word, is a perfectly acceptable way to break contact.<br/> <br/> Tom Givens, founder of Tac-Con, actually does have a better word for “retreat.” Tom prefers to talk about “preclusion,” which is the act of preventing something from happening. “I give people a double-your-money-back guarantee that you’re going to survive every single violent confrontation you don’t get in,” Tom says.<br/> <br/> "Even in the hardest of stand-your-ground states, if a jury is presented with evidence that an armed defender had a clear opportunity to safely withdraw from a potentially violent confrontation and chose to engage regardless, that jury may conclude the defender’s choice was not reasonable. If an armed defender is given the opportunity to fight or safely flee, and there is no one else in danger, the choice to stay and fight is a critical mistake. In such a case, Tom Given says, “You’re turning it into mutual combat rather than self-defense.”<br/> <br/> If people can't afford to take the time or money to go to a CCW class we have to help educate people on the right way and the wrong way of handling these situations. <br/> <br/> YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN AND WILL GO TO JAIL AND GET SUED BY THE FAMILY IF YOU DON'T HANDLE A CONFRONTATION CORRECTLY.</div><div></div></div>
