One woman, Anastasia said, "I feel like I'm pressing the play button on my life."<br/> <br/> But I have really mixed feelings about it all. I'm going to lay out a pros and cons list here and see if that helps make sense of it all.<br/> <br/> THE PROS OF TAKING THEM TO FLORIDA<br/> * This would be an interesting experiment to see how surroundings affect a person. Would a new venue give any of them an opportunity to try something new in their life?<br/> * It would be nice to drive to Florida in February.<br/> * It's going to be 70 degrees and sunny where we're headed.<br/> * I know we'd have fun on our drive.<br/> * I get stuck in the rut of my life just like homeless people. Forcing myself out of my comfort zone would be good for me.<br/> * What if one of them used the opportunity to do something really different in their life? (I don't believe a life of drugs and tent living is a bad life. It's only bad if it's not what you really want. And truthfully, if it REALLY wasn't what you wanted you'd probably change.)<br/> * There is a tent city where we are headed. Maybe I could talk to some people there and learn about it a bit.<br/> * It adds to my overall experiences in the homeless work.<br/> * Getting to spend 17 hours in a car with 3 homeless people is likely going to help me learn some new things about them.<br/> <br/> THE CONS OF TAKING THEM TO FLORIDA<br/> * Chances are very good that they will find other homeless people in Florida and end up with the same issues they have here but just down there. <br/> * I have always really disliked just giving away big things. I once gave a car to a young man that lived next to me. I think it ultimately became a tool to do more crime and caused him to go right back to jail.<br/> * I'll miss my family while I'm gone. I feel guilty about leaving them.<br/> * I feel guilty about not working at least while I'm driving.<br/> * Why do they get this thing and other people don't?<br/> * It's extra money that I don't need to spend personally.<br/> * I just feel more comfortable staying at home and not making the effort.<br/> <br/> OTHER IDEAS<br/> * Make them work for it: Get their birth certificates and IDs and then help them get on a plane to fly to Florida. Or get on a bus.<br/> <br/> (This didn't really help me much at all. I think it just comes down to not really wanting to make the effort. But maybe that's an instinct that I need to listen to.)<br/> <br/> My feeling is: I'm not super excited about this journey. But I AM excited about helping them get on an airplane. Maybe that's the route I need to go. It's kind of like a "teach them how to fish" sort of mentality.</div><div></div></div>
