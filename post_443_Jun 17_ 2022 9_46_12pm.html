This is what I hear over and over again. People keep telling me no one at our camp was trafficked.

I want to hear it from the police. I want to know what they find out.￼ The longer this sits in my head the more furious I become over the idea that someone was victimizing a person at my camp. The entire point of what I do is to provide at least a slightly better opportunity of safety than what they could get alone out in the woods.

If there was a predator who was trafficking someone at our camp I want to know who it is.￼￼￼ I just become more and more enraged at the idea that that could have happened.￼</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
