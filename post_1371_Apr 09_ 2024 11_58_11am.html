But the homeless camp sweep on April 3, 2024 was in direct violation of the 2016 consent decree. You can read it here:

When John Valley retired everyone started ignoring this decree. The city of Akron is now throwing away homeless people's belongings in direct violation of this decree.

This video is of my conversations with the Nuisance Department of Akron and Community Support Services and my observations of the camp right before everything was thrown away the day of the camp sweep.

ALL I want from you is to have a dialogue about homelessness. Every single person in a city needs a place to live. It destroys the fabric of a city to do otherwise.

This video is likely going to be difficult for you to watch, Shammas. I'm sorry for that. But you need to watch it.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
