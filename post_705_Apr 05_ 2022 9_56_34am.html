            <div class="_2pin"><div>My good friend Eric Gunsberg is back in my life. He's currently homeless. But man! That doesn't stop him from getting stuff done.<br/> <br/> He has been networking with the Peter Maurin Center to get some tents for us. They are giving out supplies today from 11-2. <br/> <br/> Is there anyone out there that would be able and willing to help Eric get over to Peter Maurin to get some tents and other supplies today?<br/> <br/> I think Peter Maurin might be doing their lunch today. So you could take Eric and maybe some others to get lunch. (And be sure to eat lunch too. It's always yummy.)<br/> <br/> Eric is currently at 85 Kent Place and needs to go to Peter Maurin. <br/> <br/> Eric is one of the coolest guys you will ever meet. He's got that super thick Brooklyn accent. He's got a million stories. You'll love him if you've never met him.</div><div></div></div>
