            <div class="_2pin"><div>I have been scratching away the surface niceties of some white friends who hold positions of power. And what I am finding makes me profoundly sad.<br/> <br/> So many of them are completely blind to their colonialism nature and gut dislike of black people. No matter how much they stomp their feet and shout, "I don't see color. I'M NOT RACIST!" - their actions say otherwise. <br/> <br/> And so we pray, "Dear Lord, Forgive them for they know not what they do."</div><div></div></div>
