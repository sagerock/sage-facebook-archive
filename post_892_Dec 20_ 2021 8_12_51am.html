I admire your connection with God. I admire your respect for tradition.<br/> <br/> YOU ARE DYING FROM COVID. <br/> <br/> I don't want you to die. You are incredibly important to the balance of America. <br/> <br/> Me. My wife. My 17 year old. And both my in-laws have all gotten 3 shots. We are all doing fine. <br/> <br/> Please get vaccinated.</div><div></div></div>
