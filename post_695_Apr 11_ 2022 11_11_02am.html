First of all, it was completely unnecessary to have your city goons call and berate the lady whose job it is to manage dumpsters. She's just doing her job. 

Second of all, threatening that if she doesn't get her dumpsters off your precious land (pictured here) by the end of today that you are going to confiscate them and not give them back, isn't even legal. It's just bullying.

Third of all, you being angry at me doesn't mean you have to take it out on other people. 

That dumpster that I PAY FOR to clean trash off the streets of YOUR CITY of homeless people will be gone today. 

I'll find another place to put my dumpster. And I'll keep cleaning trash of homeless people. Feel free to sweep my dumpsters all you want. 

I. WILL. NOT. STOP!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
