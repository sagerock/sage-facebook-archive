I took her picture. I put it on Facebook. 

And some of you crucified her. I knew some of you would.

Some of you accused her of being bad on so many levels. 

You cast the first stone. And you took great pride in doing so. 

And I am sorry to say it: but it was Christians that were most guilty of this. 

This women came to you as your savior. All you had to do is love her. And some of you did nothing other than condemn her. All you had to do is love her. And your ego would not let you do it. YOU chose to be God. To be the judge, jury and executioner. Just as they did to Jesus. Who do you think you would have been in that crowd? Do you really believe you would not be among the ones yelling “CRUCIFY HIM”

To my Christian friends I ask: Would you know your savior if he was standing right before your eyes? I have very serious doubts. 

And as in the original story, it was a few women who came to stand with her. A wealthy woman bought her a heater. A poor woman comes daily to her tent to comfort her and take care of her. I don’t known their official position on Christianity. Have they said the magic words that some of you require in order to get into Heaven? I have no idea. 

But I know one thing for certain. They understand the Christ truth at their very core. Love. Love. Love. Just love. 

“But Sage…”. NO BUT. JUST LOVE. 

WHEN WILL YOU HEAR THE TRUTH?…

Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’

41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’

44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’

45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
