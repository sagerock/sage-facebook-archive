I do this in remembrance that Jesus' mom was a VERY pregnant young teenager (between 12-14 years old) who had nowhere to sleep and had to give birth to her son (and, some believe, the Son of God) in either a stable (Jesus was born in a feed trough, which we call a manger), or in a cave. 

Either way, no one came to her rescue. Every year I work with homeless pregnant women that have to sleep outside until the very moment they give birth and then within a couple days they go right back to their tent without their child. 

How can we be the richest country in the world and the most, supposedly, Christian country in the world and allow this travesty to happen? Did we not learn ONE SINGLE THING from the story of Jesus? 

My big focus for donations this year is going to be zero degree sleeping bags, camping matts and small tents. I am not able to provide electricity to people because the city had me rip it out of our house and it is now illegal for me to put a single tent on my personal property. 

And I just don't have the physical energy to move propane tanks. (There may be others that will provide Buddy Heaters and propane. But I'm not going to do it this year.)

I have slept out in quite cold weather and I believe in the ability of a zero degree sleeping bag to keep you warm. So, that is going to be my focus this year. If you have the ability to buy one to donate, please do. They are about $50-$75 on Amazon. You can drop it off to me on Christmas Eve night. 

I will also gladly accept hats, gloves, scarves and socks. Always socks.

Last year I had 3 people sleep out with me. This was not what I had planned. But I've had some people request to do this again. 

If you feel compelled to join me I won't stop you. You are certainly welcome to join me. BUT!!! There are some things you need to be aware of:

1. I have not asked permission to do this on the property that I am on. So this is trespassing... just like all homeless people in Akron that have nowhere to sleep.

2. Akron streets are dangerous. There was a fight last year. This is not make believe. I cannot be responsible for your safety. People will be walking the streets all night long. I find it very unnerving and stressful. I also find that I come out of this with a slight amount of trauma... just like all homeless people in Akron that have nowhere to sleep.

3. You are responsible for all your gear. A small tent is better than a bigger tent to help keep in your body warmth. You should bring a tarp and extra cord and extra tent stakes in case it rains. Cheap tents are very unreliable. You need to put something under you so that the earth does not take all your body warmth. Cardboard or a camping matt is needed. A zero degree sleeping bag is needed. You are on your own for supplies. I cannot help you if you join me... just like all homeless people in Akron that have nowhere to sleep.

4. There is no toilet. Either bring something to pee in or wear a diaper. No one will have a place for you to go to the bathroom... just like all homeless people in Akron that have nowhere to sleep.

While I'm uneasy about the idea of people sleeping out with me (except for homeless people. They get it and I don't have to worry about them.), I would LOVE for you to stop by and say hello and bring any donations, if you'd like. I will try to stay awake until about 11. (I went to bed earlier last year and some people still came. I felt bad about missing them.) 

I love you and am so thankful for the kindness and generosity you have shown our homeless neighbors over the years. You are wonderful. 

Thank you.
Sage
