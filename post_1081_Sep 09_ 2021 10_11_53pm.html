            <div class="_2pin"><div>An academic named John J. DiIulio Jr. coined the term "Super Predator" in 1995. Biden passed the his racist crime bill. And now he's president. <br/> <br/> Mark my words: black communities will yet again be villanized and targeted by the ruling class. <br/> <br/> From "How to be an Anti-racist,"<br/> “Most inner-city children grow up surrounded by teenagers and adults who are themselves deviant, delinquent or criminal,” DiIulio wrote. Watch out. “A new generation of street criminals is upon us—the youngest, biggest and baddest generation any society has ever known,” he warned. My band of “juvenile ‘super-predators’ ” were “radically impulsive, brutally remorseless youngsters, including ever more preteenage boys, who murder, assault, rape, rob, burglarize, deal deadly drugs, join gun-toting gangs and create serious communal disorders.”</div><div></div></div>
