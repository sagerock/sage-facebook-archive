            <div class="_2pin"><div>I've never experienced a more cold, callous and condescending city spokesperson than City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office Ellen Lander Nischt.<br/> <br/> A Silver Lake employee found a $4.4 million sewer billing error that was the fault of Akron city. Silver Lake, rightfully, wants Akron to pay for the 220 hours it took them to find Akron's mistake. <br/> <br/> Akron "city spokesperson Ellen Lander Nischt said the city does acknowledge there was a clerical error, but added Housley's job involves ensuring the village pays "the appropriate funds for amounts owed."<br/> <br/> "Occasionally, as was the case here, that job may include detecting and resolving clerical errors," she said. "Akron did not request, authorize, review, receive or approve any work completed by Silver Lake."</div><div></div></div>
