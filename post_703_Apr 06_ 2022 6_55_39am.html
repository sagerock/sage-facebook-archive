            <div class="_2pin"><div>All of this is about connection. About how similar we all are. <br/> <br/> How a human is a close cousin to a sponge. How a skyscraper is made from the same building blocks as our bodies. <br/> <br/> (You are probably willing to see those connections. But now watch this.)<br/> <br/> How a Christian can't be a Christian without being a Jew first. How a Muslim can't be a Muslim without being a Jew and Christian first. <br/> <br/> How a Universalist Unitarian can't be a UU without being an Orthodox Catholic first. <br/> <br/> How a believer can't be a believer without being an atheist first. <br/> <br/> How a Communist can't be a Communist without being a capitalist first. <br/> <br/> How an anti-racist can't be an anti-racist without being a racist first. <br/> <br/> YOU CAN'T BE WHAT YOU WANT TO BECOME WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU HAVE THE THING YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST JUST BELOW THE SURFACE. <br/> <br/> Everything is everything. <br/> <br/> Stop hating. Stop dividing. Stop separating. Start understanding. <br/> <br/> You are the thing you hate. You are the thing you love. The fight isn't an external battle. The battle is within you. It always has been. <br/> <br/> You are the entire universe.</div><div></div></div>
