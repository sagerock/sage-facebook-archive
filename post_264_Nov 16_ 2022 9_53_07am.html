They swept all known homeless camps in Akron Ohio on this day. It was 32 degrees and was snowing off and on during the sweep. Not one single homeless service provider had EVER come to meet with these people. No one was on site to support these homeless people. They were given nowhere to go. 

They originally came to this camp after they swept my camp on my personal property. I have now been given a court order that I will face jail time and fines if I put so much as one single tent on my land. 

The are fighting a war against homeless people. The plan is clearly to push these people out of the city. But because they have no phones, no ideas and no resources they, of course, can't leave Akron. 

This is absolutely how genocidal eradications begin. And it's being run by the Democrats... the supposed group of people that care about people.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
