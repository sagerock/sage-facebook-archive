He has spent 18 years in prison and has untreated mental illness. 

He’s a wonderful artist and incredibly smart. He’s just stuck. He knows it and is having a really difficult time getting unstuck. 

I thought this gun might help him get back into his art. He was SO excited. 

It was stolen within 3 days. I haven’t seen him in over a week.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
