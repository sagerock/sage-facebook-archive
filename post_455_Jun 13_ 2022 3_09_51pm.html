Government money is highly restricted. Homeless prevention and rapid rehousing are pretty much the only things they can spend federal money on. I'm not mad at the limited work the government can do in homeless innovation. 

I also firmly believe that the government should NOT invest monetarily into the kind of work that I'm doing. I believe it should be all private funds. That way they don't have to condone it. But the work is still getting done.

I am an alcoholic. I could drink 30 beers and some shots on any given night. I quite drinking July 9, 2003. That will be 19 years coming up soon.

I have taken to sheltering drug addicts almost entirely. Everyone else turns them away. I have a kindred spirit with them. So, I like being around them. But I get that it is controversial work. So, I only want people to support our work that WANT to support our work. BUT SOMEONE HAS TO DO IT. They don't just disappear if I stop sheltering them.

Now I am being sued by the city and threatened with arrest by the police for lighting a Remembrance Fire for our Brother Andrew who passed away last week. 

Do they think that if I stop giving them a tent, toilet and trash service that drug addiction will end? That they will all just go back home? I honestly cannot understand the thinking of why the government is so against what I'm doing. Except when I plug in the variable that the government doesn't like these people and doesn't want them in their city. THEN their actions make perfect sense.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
