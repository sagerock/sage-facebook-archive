            <div class="_2pin"><div>I am EXTREMELY thankful we are talking about homelessness in Akron Ohio again. <br/> <br/> I’ve said it before (a thousand times) and I’ll say it again: If you don’t like how I’m sheltering people then WHAT IS YOUR SOLUTION?<br/> <br/> Because leaving them ignored in the woods is not a viable “solution.” It creates endless trash. Diseases are rampant becomes of no running water, toilets or trash service. And it’s all happening on land these peoples are illegally using. <br/> <br/> You can hate homeless people and agree with me that is not the answer. But right now that IS the answer. And it’s wrong on every imaginable level.</div><div></div></div>
