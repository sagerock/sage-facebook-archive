            <div class="_2pin"><div>If you hold somewhere in your mind that drug users are morally or mentally weak, I'd like to remind you of all the food you jammed in your pie hole this last weekend. You didn't need that food to survive. You "needed" that food to feel good emotionally. <br/> <br/> If you are overweight (like I am) you are addicted to food. <br/> <br/> And I'm here to tell you: You aren't morally or mentally weak either. Your brain is addicted to the feeling of "comfort food" and it will stop at nothing to convince you to eat as much of it as you possibly can. <br/> <br/> And that's why heart disease is the biggest killer in America.<br/> <br/> If you have ever overeaten, you did it because it felt good EMOTIONALLY to do. And you are experiencing that same thing a meth or fentanyl user is experiencing. (Except your drug is NOWHERE near as powerful as their drug.)</div><div></div></div>
