She’s pregnant in a tent. 

I offered her a room in my house. She said no. People have told me a bunch of reasons why she won’t go. (Rules are definitely not one of them). But it doesn’t matter.  She doesn’t want to go. That’s all that matters. 

Another friend of mine messaged me and asked me what we could do. I was so focused on putting her in my house that I had no ideas. I had one idea, it failed and that was it. This friend then said, “Could we get her a heater?” 

OF COURSE we could get a heater. I sent this friend a link to the heater on Amazon. Along with the connection hose so you can use a gas grill tank with it. This friend didn’t buy one heater. She bought 2!

This is Aubrey with that heater, hose and tank. 

We must meet these people where they are. Not where we want them to be. They are human beings for God’s sake. 

When you agree to have a society you then become responsible for ALL the people in the society.  Not just the ones you like. 

This problem isn’t that hard if you stop looking at one solution and open your mind and heart to ALL the solutions.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
