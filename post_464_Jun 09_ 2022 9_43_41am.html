So many of us have always lived in a child-like pretend world where justice is served and our government will protect us.

NO ONE IS COMING FOR YOU. You are all alone. THE SYSTEM IS NOT GOING TO COME FOR YOU IN YOUR TIME OF NEED.

All you have is your community... and sadly, most of us have little to no community at all. Please work on growing some sort of community connection. THEY will jump in a lake to save you. THEY will cloth you and feed you. THEY will save you. Not the government.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
