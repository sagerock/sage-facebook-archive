Matthew, in this picture, was in a manic bipolar episode. Deputies in Savannah, Ga., beat him, handcuffed him, put him in a restraint chair with a spit mask over his face and shocked him four times in the groin with a Taser.

The experts said he died of natural causes. 

This is why people hate the police and don't trust the science of global warming and vaccine safety.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
