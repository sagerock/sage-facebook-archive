            <div class="_2pin"><div>We all know what the answer is: More compassion. More understanding. More love. <br/> <br/> WE ALL KNOW IT. <br/> <br/> But very few of us know how to get there. <br/> <br/> I’d like to suggest that there are nearly infinite ways to get there. They are all just tools to get you over the bridge to the Promised Land. <br/> <br/> Jesus. <br/> Muhammad. <br/> Joseph Smith. <br/> L. Ron Hubbard. <br/> Carl Jung. <br/> Joseph Campbell. <br/> Behavioral psychology. <br/> Psychoanalysis. <br/> AA. <br/> Albert Camus. <br/> Anthroposophy. <br/> Walking in the woods. <br/> Plant medicine. <br/> <br/> They are all just tools. Some use the spirit to get us there. Some use the mind. <br/> <br/> I think we run into so many people that tell us that their way is the only way. And when that way doesn’t resonate with us then we just freeze. We believe the propaganda. So we stop searching. We think love and compassion is not meant for us. <br/> <br/> BUT HEAR THIS: We are all just trying to connect with each other, Earth and the universe. We are happier when we are on that path of connection. We are less happy when we are alone and isolated. <br/> <br/> Connection is the goal. Get there any way you want.</div><div></div></div>
