Iâ€™ve done it for years. 

When I first started this I thought that the winter months were going to be very quiet. That people would somehow figure out a place to sleep inside. I WAS WRONG. 

Winter is the busiest time. 

People that walked the streets all night or slept in a corner of an alley, now need real shelter. I never give away more tents than in the winter. 

I bought these for specific people that came to me for tents yesterday.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
