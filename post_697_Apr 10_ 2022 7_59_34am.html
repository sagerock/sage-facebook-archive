            <div class="_2pin"><div>My son increased his ACT score from 17 to 22. <br/> <br/> He's a junior. I think if he can get it to 24 he'll qualify for a free ride to University of Akron. (but my wife always makes a point that cost is not the priority for where our son goes to college.)<br/> <br/> We probably spent nearly $1000 on a high end calculator (he lost it so we'll have to buy another one), half a dozen books and online courses. <br/> <br/> For about 3 months we would all gather around our 86 inch TV each night as I streamed courses from my iPad to our TV. <br/> <br/> You see, not only do I have spare time and money to help homeless people and run for mayor, I also have free time to be my son's personal ACT and Algebra II tutor. <br/> <br/> I'm rich. I have generational wealth and I have personal wealth. I just get richer and richer. <br/> <br/> And when my son gets out of college I'm sure we'll offer him a free house to move into. We've got a few. He probably won't want any of them. So we'll probably help him buy one that he does want. <br/> <br/> THE NUMBER ONE FACTOR IN STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES IS INCOME. <br/> <br/> The richer you are the better you will do on these tests. And so then these kids go to better schools, get better scholarships. And they start their lives ahead of the game when they already were miles ahead to begin with. <br/> <br/> THE WORKING CLASS MUST UNITE AND EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD. This is not just or fair.</div><div></div></div>
