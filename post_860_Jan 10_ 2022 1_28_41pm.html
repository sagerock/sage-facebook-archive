Nothing to see here. I've never even heard about priests loving to diddle little boys?<br/> <br/> Republican? Donald Trump is the greatest human to ever walk earth. And anyone who says ANYTHING against him needs to be cancelled.<br/> <br/> Jewish? If you even so much as say a Jewish person j-walked you are an anti-Semite. <br/> <br/> We will only get better when we stop looking outward and blaming everyone else for our problems (this is a recurring theme with my homeless friends).<br/> <br/> Change starts at home.</div><div></div></div>
