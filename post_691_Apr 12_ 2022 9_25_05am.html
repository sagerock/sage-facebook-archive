            <div class="_2pin"><div>Hey City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office - would you PLEASE talk to your police officers and your parole officers about the tent communities we build?<br/> <br/> I am working on building a good relationship with one police officer in particular. He knows 8 people in our village. And whenever he needs to talk with them he knows right where they are. <br/> <br/> He doesn't have to wonder around the woods all day trying to find where his people are because YOU keep sweeping their camps.</div><div></div></div>
