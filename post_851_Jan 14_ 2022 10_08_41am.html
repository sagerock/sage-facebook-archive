            <div class="_2pin"><div>I just saw on Nextdoor this message:<br/> There is now a homeless camp in Fairlawn off Rothrock Road, near the Sherwin Williams/Urban Air Adventure. <br/> <br/> Akron is neglecting its homeless population and now its spilling over into other communities. <br/> <br/> I will take care of these people with private money on private property. They will have rules, running water, showers, trash service and internet access. <br/> <br/> I want ZERO money from the government. But I'm continually not allowed to do this work.<br/> <br/> And now it's moving into your neighborhood.<br/> <br/> Tell Dan Horrigan to let me shelter homeless people. <br/> Here's his phone number:<br/> (330) 375-2345</div><div></div></div>
