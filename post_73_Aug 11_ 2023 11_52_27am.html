He has been in our yard the last 2 days. He’s extremely agitated. He yells at us. But I don’t think he is a danger to himself or others. I tried to pink slip him. The CIT officers said there is nothing they can do. 

He won’t leave our yard. I don’t mind. But guys like this sometimes spook other people. It’s always guys like HIM that are more at risk of being hurt. 

I’d love to give him a tent. He’s the perfect person for that kind of shelter. But I’ll go to jail if I do that. So he’s just left to roam our yard. 

If anyone knows him please let me know.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
