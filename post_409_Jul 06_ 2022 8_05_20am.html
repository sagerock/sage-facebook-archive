            <div class="_2pin"><div>I believe there are 3 general categories of cops.<br/> <br/> 1. Good cops - they are thoughtful and empathetic to the people they work with and generally like the people on the street.<br/> <br/> 2. Mislead cops - they want to help. They came to this job to do good. But they are afraid of the people they deal with. They don't understand addiction and mental illness and the general condition of low income, primarily Black communities.<br/> <br/> 3. Bad cops - they feel like they are part of a gang. They are always looking for a fight. They hate the people on the street. <br/> <br/> MOST COPS fall into the second category. And that's why I believe police reform is very possible. <br/> <br/> De-escalation training. Relationship building. Support from mental health providers, housing providers and homeless services providers.</div><div></div></div>
