            <div class="_2pin"><div>I grew up Methodist. I spent several years constructing my faith going to church with the Mennonites and the Baháʼí faith. <br/> <br/> And then I deconstructed it all as an atheist. <br/> <br/> Today I am in my reconstruction phase building it all again. But the reconstruction is very different from the original construction. <br/> <br/> This is the full message of Jesus. Birth. Life. Death. Rebirth. We cannot give into the temptation to get stuck in any one phase. The cycle, the circle of life, is the message.</div><div></div></div>
