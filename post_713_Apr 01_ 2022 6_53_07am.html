They are experiencing a humanitarian torture, cruelty and murder on par with the bloody nightmare of African American slavery and Native American genocide. 

YOU NEED TO KNOW that America has a barbaric side that will gladly destroy and kill its own citizens in order to pave roads and clear "green spaces" for for the pleasure of wealthy whites. 

YOU NEED TO KNOW that the only reason I continue fighting (I was with the attorneys from @[100064866185185:2048:Institute for Justice]  yesterday at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals continuing our years-long fight for my right to shelter those most critically in need of shelter) because of YOU. I have seen goodness and kindness and compassion that was previously unimaginable to me before this work. Humanity, in all it's glaring sins, is fundamentally good. I've seen it. I know it to be absolutely true. 

I endlessly fight this battle because you deserve more warriors to stand up and fight for the goodness that lives within all of us.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
