This was taken just a few minutes ago. 

They weren’t there for our residents. They were there for a homeless person who has had his home destroyed by the city over and over again. He just recently had his camp swept the week before thanksgiving. 

This is how it works: the system kicks you over and over again. And then when you start doing crimes either out of necessity or out of anger and frustration, you are then labeled as a no good criminal that needs to get his act together. Or I’m seeing the talk of extermination starting to gain traction here in 21st century America. 

This is at the heart of classism and racism. Wealthy white people tell Black people to get father figures in their family lives even though they are either in jail for drug possession or are dead. And poor people need to put down the needle and get a job. 

Wealthy white people’s ignorance and prejudice is the driving force of most of the world’s problems.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
