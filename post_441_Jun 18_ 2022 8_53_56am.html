In a nutshell, it is coercing someone to give sex or have sex for something like money or drugs or anything really.<br/> <br/> Let me tell you a little story about my coercion capabilities...<br/> <br/> A couple weeks ago I asked a woman to pay for her tent. I asked her to pay for it because she already had 2 tents (against our policy, by the way. Everyone is only supposed to have 1 tent).<br/> <br/> She wanted a bigger tent.<br/> <br/> I have always felt bad for her because she has not adjusted well to tent life. She's new to the scene and it's been hard on her.<br/> <br/> So I said, "pay me $100 and I will buy you this $170 tent." <br/> She said, "Fine. Go buy the tent."<br/> I said, "No. You pay me first.<br/> She said, "JUST GO GET ME THE TENT!"<br/> I said, "OK."<br/> <br/> I went and got her the tent.<br/> <br/> I brought the tent to her. <br/> She said, "I only have $15. But I'll get the rest to you soon."<br/> I said, "You have to pay me all of it first before you get the tent."<br/> She said, "JUST GIVE ME THE TENT!"<br/> I said, "OK.<br/> <br/> I never saw another dime of that $100. However, I did pay her $40 because she bought a purse from a person who shouldn't have sold her the purse. It was causing a huge drama at the camp. So I said, "If I pay you the $40 that you paid for the purse will you give the purse back.<br/> She said, "Yes."<br/> <br/> I can't coerce these people into anything. Just yesterday, I packed countless bags of rotting food that was laying on the ground in bloated bags and buzzing with flies onto my truck and threw it away in our dumpster.<br/> <br/> I'm not saying people don't work. A lot of people do a lot of work at our camp. But it's certainly not because I asked them to or "coerced" them to.</div><div></div></div>
