Most people just complain and do nothing about it. You did something and that's huge.<br/> <br/> Maybe the process will inspire you to run again. We need candidates that excite the electorate. Your passion for the issues that matter to you is contagious. Don't give up. Keep trying.</div><div></div></div>
