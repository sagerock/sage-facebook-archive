            <div class="_2pin"><div>SEX TRAFFICKING<br/> <br/> From what I know about the homeless community, this is the kind of sex trafficking that goes on...<br/> <br/> Yesterday I came up on 2 very serious guys. One Black. One White. They were squaring off on each other. I asked them what was going on. The Black guy said that the White guy had taken on the debt of a woman ($100). <br/> <br/> This woman is not dumb by any stretch of the imagination. She is both book smart and street smart. <br/> <br/> She was given drugs on credit by the Black guy.<br/> <br/> A woman who does this is almost always planning on paying for the drugs with services. $100 is a HUGE number in the homeless community. Sex work sells for about $20 per service in my neighborhood. So she was easily looking at 5 services plus probably some interest.<br/> <br/> My guess is that she didn't want to have sex with the guy that she bought the drugs from (I've never seen her with a Black guy. I don't think she's particularly racist. I just don't think that's what's she's in to.)<br/> <br/> So she sold the debt to the White guy. (I have no idea where he's going to come up with $100. He has a severe gambling addiction. Nearly every dollar he gets goes into a tap tap machine or scratch off.)<br/> <br/> But I suspect he's willing to take the debt and not worry about the consequences of what happens of not paying it back. (These 2 guys are equally muscular, strong and violent. And the Black guy can be pretty mentally unstable at times. It could get ugly.)<br/> <br/> So that's where we are in this story.<br/> <br/> I suspect the woman will "pay" up on the debt with the White guy. I've known him to do incredibly violent and cruel things to people. No one in our community would ever think they could get out of a debt to this guy. She knew EXACTLY what she was getting into when she sold her debt to this guy.<br/> <br/> But in another situation this is where things get complicated. I think sometimes a woman makes this deal and then doesn't want to do the trade. <br/> <br/> They are dealing with drug dealers. A drug dealer is a capitalist that collects on debts. It's a matter of pride and respect, more than anything.<br/> <br/> So, a woman gets in this situation and then is forced to pay. It looks like rape. And considering that she is forced to have sex against her will, it meets the definition of rape. It's a mess. I've bought debts for a few women in my time, to get them out of these brutal situations. But I certainly can't do it all the time. I'd go broke.<br/> <br/> I am not here to give you a moral to this story. I am here to just tell you the story in case you aren't familiar with the situation.<br/> <br/> I tell everyone, men and women: DON'T OWE THE DOPE BOY. But they just keep doing it because they think they can pay it off. The dope boy knows they aren't going to be able to pay it off and then they have created a slave. It's not always about sex. For men, it's often about becoming a weapon that will attack the dope boy's enemies.</div><div></div></div>
