She just needs someone to help oversee the move. And she may need help moving herself as she is in a wheelchair. <br/> <br/> She currently lives in Springfield and is probably moving to Akron.<br/> <br/> If you are interested in helping please message me and I'll give you the details.</div><div></div></div>
