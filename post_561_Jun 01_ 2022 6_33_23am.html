He's made personalized caskets for all 19 kids who were killed in the Uvalde massacre. 

I NEED YOU TO KNOW, TO DEEPLY UNDERSTAND, that good and bad balance. (in fact, I see so much good in the world that I dare say that the good always wins out. )

I'm not saying that suffering doesn't exist. It most certainly does. What I am saying is that the greater the suffering the greater the good people will GUARANTEE to flock to where the pain and suffering is EVERY time.
