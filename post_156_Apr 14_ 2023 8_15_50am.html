Tara Mosely is exactly what Akron needs right now. 

We are entering a time of sadness, desperation, isolation and hopelessness. I'm telling you, Jayland Walker's murderers will not be indicted 

We will, yet again, learn that the laws of the system are only here for one thing: To protect the ruling class. 

The very idea of a grand jury is to protect the ruling class. How can an anonymous group of people get to decide if someone should face a trial or not? Grand jurors lack the legal knowledge necessary to determine if there is a case or not. So the powerful use their ignorance to their benefit and get their friends (and this care, their enforcers) out of an actual trial.

I honestly just thought it was poor people and Black people they villainize. But now with the White Pond atrocity, hopefully you know that they hate all of us. We are the enemy of the powerful. We are only good for one thing: to make them more money. If we can't make them more money we are garbage the needs to be thrown away. 

Shammas Malik is a good guy. But he does not have the emotional intelligence that we need right now. Marco Sommerville is just an old out of touch guy that thinks he deserves to be mayor because he put in his time. 

There is only one right answer for mayor of Akron right now: TARA MOSELY.

But you must be brave, Akron. You must not pull another Bernie Sanders, "But he can't win," stunt. Tara only loses if you decide that she loses. 

You are kind and wonderful. Give yourself the leader you deserve. Vote for Tara Mosely on May 2, 2023.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
