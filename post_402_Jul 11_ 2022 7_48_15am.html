            <div class="_2pin"><div>IN NEED OF AN ELECTRICIAN FOR OUR CHURCH OF THE NOMADIC SPIRIT HOUSE<br/> <br/> So here's the thing: I had an electrician put 7 outlets on our house to use in the tents we had on our land for homeless people. But he didn't pull any permits. He has since disappeared.<br/> <br/> Part of the agreement with the city of Akron (which requires me to never put up a tent anywhere in Akron ever again) is that I pull a permit for this work.<br/> <br/> DOES ANYONE KNOW AN ELECTRICIAN that would be willing to help me do this? <br/> <br/> It doesn't have to be free. I'm happy to pay. I just need it done. Otherwise I'll have to pull out all these outlets that homeless people are using for things like charging their phones and things like that.<br/> <br/> Thank you as always.<br/> Sage</div><div></div></div>
