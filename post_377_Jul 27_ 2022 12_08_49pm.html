I wish I had taken a "before" picture of this storage room. It was a total mess. She organized and cleaned the entire room.

We got her ID a few weeks ago. Last Friday she got a phone. 

She had nowhere to stay after the city forced us to close our tent city. I and some others finally convinced her to go to the battered women's shelter.

These were all huge steps in her life.

She was kicked out of the shelter after 2 nights. She asked what she did. They told her they didn't know. She asked if she could get her belongings. They told her to come back later.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
