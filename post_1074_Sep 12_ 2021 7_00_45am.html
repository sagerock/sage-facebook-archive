            <div class="_2pin"><div>Hey Starbucks - west market in Akron Ohio is not your personal drive through lane. So I'm starting a protest. Every time I get stuck in your traffic that pours out on the street I'm going to sit there and lay on the horn. Now, you may not think that's much of anything to worry about. But have you been to Akron Ohio recently? Everybody is shooting everybody. There is a pretty good chance someone is going to get shot. And since I don't carry any weapons that someone is probably going to be me. <br/> If you would rather not be in the news for someone being murdered in front of your store...STOP LETTING PEOPLE USE THE STREET AS YOUR DRIVE THROUGH LANE.</div><div></div></div>
