I understand that you were at the Church of the Nomadic Spirit last night. And you found some people remembering their brother who died on this ground a weeks or so ago. They lit a fire in our circle of life as humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years as a form of sacred remembrance.￼

As nomads, fire is fundamental to our beliefs of freedom and autonomy, which are not unlike the freedoms that the pilgrims came to America to also practice.

Apparently you threatened them that if they continued to light this fire they would arrest the owner. I’m assuming you’re talking about me. I would prefer that you refer to me as pastor or minister of the Church of the Nomadic Spirit. Because that’s who I am. 

If you want to arrest me for practicing spiritual beliefs at our church I will more than happily take you up on the offer. Just simply message me here to show up at jail and I will gladly go.￼
