I want to thank @[100028064979054:2048:Omi Kelley] for pointing out an ignorant statement I made about single black mom's on crack. It's one of those things that some white people say without thinking about it. I then added something like "...like Lebron's mom." 

It's not a black and white thing. It's a rich and poor thing. 
I then tried to defend myself by saying the only person I know who used crack is a black guy. But that's not true. VERY few of my friends smoke crack. Most use meth. But I know 2 people who smoke crack. A black guy and white guy. Crack is not a black or white drug. 

My point in telling you this is that trying to move from being racist to anti-racist as @[100044231119219:2048:Ibram X. Kendi] teaches is a journey. We can all fall prey to it. It's a lazy way of thinking. 

I believe that the only way we will get better is by not being afraid of our ignorance. Don't bury it so even you can't look at it. Get it out there so we can all learn from it. 

YES. I say and do racist things. But I sincerely am trying to learn and get better. And I appreciate when people help me see when I'm making these mistakes.

Thank you Omi!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
