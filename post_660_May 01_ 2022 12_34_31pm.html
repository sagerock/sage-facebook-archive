            <div class="_2pin"><div>I have many weaknesses. (I make a point of showing you some of these failings to make sure you understand that I'm just a regular human like all of us. There is nothing "saintly" about what I am doing. I'm just doing having fun, making mistakes and doing exactly what I want to do with my life. )<br/> <br/> From an organizational point of view, my failings actually become problematic structurally. I have 2 issues I REALLY need your help with...<br/> <br/> 1. So much of the work I do with homeless people is purely selfish. I love cleaning up trash and I love working on community organizing with homeless people. I just do what I want to do. I'm a volunteer so I feel like I can be self-centered that way. <br/> <br/> 2. I'm introverted. I love working alone. I naturally pull away from group work. <br/> <br/> But if we are to grow our houseless movement I desperately need your help. Additionally, many of you have asked me repeatedly how to help. I've been putting it off for the reasons mentioned above. <br/> <br/> I'VE GOT TO DO BETTER AT THIS for the good of the homeless community.<br/> <br/> To begin this process I'd like to start collecting names, email addresses and/or mobile numbers. I'm going to use some tools to help us all communicate better together.<br/> <br/> WOULD YOU MESSAGE ME YOUR NAME, EMAIL AND/OR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER IF YOU'D LIKE TO BE MADE AWARE OF VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITITES?</div><div></div></div>
