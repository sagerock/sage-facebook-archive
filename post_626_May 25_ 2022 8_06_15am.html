We must love the families of Uvalde Texas and the incredible anguish they are experiencing this morning.

And we must love Salvador Ramos, the young man who killed all those children. (I know some of you are going to be angry at this position. But that's all the more reason to have it.)

Salvador had very few friends. He was often bullied over a speech impediment that included a stutter and lisp. He once cut up his own face with a knife “just for fun.”

I am all for looking at tightening gun laws. But truly this is just a way for politicians to divide us as a nation and for gun companies to sell more guns. The real issue, of course, is mental health.

Mental health isn't divisive. It doesn't get more people worked up to hate their fellow Americas who think differently than themselves. And it certainly doesn't sell more guns. 

But mental health is the elephant in the room. From homelessness to addiction to suicide to school shootings. We have completely abandoned our mentally ill neighbors in America. 

Please let your hearts and minds stay soft and vulnerable during these times. Try to avoid the very compelling desire to become hard and hateful. Love solves problems. Hate creates problems.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
