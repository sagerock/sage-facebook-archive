            <div class="_2pin"><div>A 67-year-old woman messaged me at 5pm last night. She asked how late our homeless warming center would be open because she wanted to bring some groceries by.<br/> <br/> She ended up bringing bags and bags of groceries. It took 3 of us a few trips to bring it all in.<br/> <br/> She said she wanted to do this because people helped her when she was homeless. <br/> <br/> She said she was homeless because of drinking. <br/> <br/> She said she quit drinking and learned to love herself. <br/> <br/> In a million years, you would never look at this woman and think she was once homeless and an alcoholic.  She has a nice car, and the ability to buy all these groceries. She just looks like a well-off 67-year-old woman.<br/> <br/> I have a family friend who died from alcoholism. She had everything. Money, 2 beautiful young children, a nice husband, a great job. They would go on these incredible tropical resort vacations. <br/> <br/> She drank herself to death. She died in a rundown, cheap motel. <br/> <br/> The best part of addiction is that you can be a raging addict 30 seconds ago. And you can be sober right now. <br/> <br/> Every recovering addict had that split second where they were out of control one minute. And they were sober the next. It's so cool. <br/> <br/> I've been sober over 20 years. <br/> <br/> I can't say I love myself, like the woman in this story. But I can say that I love life. I'm having such a wonderful time on planet Earth. I love the food and the scenery. The people are SO crazy. I can't get enough of them. "What are they going to do next!?" is always on my mind.<br/> <br/> Now we have Netflix, and I am on the edge of my seat about whether or not we are going to find out that the government has known all along that there are aliens. <br/> <br/> I think if you can find something to love then you have a reason to stop slowly killing yourself with drugs and alcohol. Yourself, the world, polar bears, your kids, God. Whatever. <br/> <br/> I see homeless people recover and move on all the time. It never has anything to do with me. It always has everything to do with themselves. An addict is ready to quit when they are ready to quit and not a moment before then. And nothing you can do will change that.</div><div></div></div>
