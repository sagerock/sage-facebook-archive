            <div class="_2pin"><div>MY CURRENT THINKING ON HATEFUL COMMENTORS<br/> <br/> I've always wanted people to have their say on what I discuss. I understand that the actions and ideas I present are controversial in some circles. And clearly the entire topic of homelessness and drug use are debatable. But I'm changing on that thinking. <br/> <br/> I love the First Amendment and the philosophy it represents. Words will not kill anyone directly. But they certainly can change the tide of things. I understand that this is my private account. But I like that we can discuss issues together. <br/> <br/> Even if I don't like what someone has said to me, I often can find something helpful in their anger that helps me grow a little. <br/> <br/> My primary hater is back. He's coming at me again with multiple accounts and texting me and messaging me. <br/> <br/> I know a little about this person. What I know is that he lost someone very dear to him to drugs. And I know that he has serious mental health issues. <br/> <br/> My thinking today is that by letting him talk, it works him up. The more he talks the more he talks. So I've taken to deleting and blocking all his accounts. <br/> <br/> I think it is not healthy for him to keep churning up this anger he has for me. <br/> <br/> And I know that it also hurts my friends to see his hateful comments. It scares them for my safety. <br/> <br/> So, these days I'm deleting comments and accounts that hate me, homeless people, addicted people, poor people and Black people.<br/> <br/> It's not that I don't want to hear their thoughts. But it's that I don't think it's healthy for them or you to have to be exposed to them. <br/> <br/> This is how I'm going to proceed:<br/> If I feel like you are coming from a place of rational discussion (and I know that's going to be a huge judgement call) then you are welcome to say anything you want.<br/> <br/> But if you start going off about how homeless people are losers that should get a job (or some variation of that) I'm probably going to delete your comments and block you. <br/> <br/> I understand you think that all these people need to do is walk down the street and stop in at any machine shop or fast food place and get a job. I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. I've heard it and I understand that's your position. But I don't need to hear it any more. I get it. These are complicated situations. If you tell me some ham-fisted "solution" to homelessness like this, I'm probably going to delete your comment and I probably will just block you. <br/> <br/> Same goes with telling me that people just need to quit drugs. Same goes with telling me that Black women need to get a man in their life because Black communities are terrible because of single moms. <br/> <br/> I feel a little sad that I'm doing this. But ultimately I'm doing it because I feel like the hate hurts you and hurts others.</div><div></div></div>
