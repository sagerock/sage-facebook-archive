            <div class="_2pin"><div>In Akron, Ward races are often just won on name recognition. We don't have ward debates, for example. <br/> <br/> I don't want to win on name recognition. I want to win because you think I would be the better of the 2 options you have for Ward 8 Representative. <br/> <br/> Here are some thoughts on my beliefs about policing, racism and addiction. <br/> <br/> If you have any questions please let me know. <br/> <br/> PLEASE VOTE MAY 2, 2023. <br/> <br/> #sageforakron8</div><div></div></div>
