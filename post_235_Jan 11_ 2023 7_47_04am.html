She was close to the Akron tent city family. 

Apparently she died of an overdose. I think she may have also been pregnant. 

I’ve lost many friends needlessly to unregulated drugs that are demonized by self-righteous moralistic, judgmental people who often call themselves “Christian” but yet never understood a single word their Savior spoke to them. 

I’m sick of it. Love your neighbor. Love your enemy. Or at least stop lying about who you really are.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
