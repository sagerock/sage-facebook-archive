Otherwise they’d come after all the Christian minister child predators. 

This is about one thing: LGBTQIA hate. 

Conservatives are organized and powerfully effective right now in taking away rights of anyone they don’t like. It’s primarily women and the LGBTQIA family at this point. But their list of hate is long and deep. 

We can’t just disregard them as stupid and racist. They are murderous radical terrorists who are organized and in control of the Republican Party. 

I’ll fight for their rights. But only if they stop trying to destroy the rights of others. 

Arm yourselves both with guns and political power. Conservatives are the true danger in America today.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
