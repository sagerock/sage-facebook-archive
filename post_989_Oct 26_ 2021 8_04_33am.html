            <div class="_2pin"><div>I want to brush up on my Algebra 2 skills. So I'm following along in the work my kid is doing in his inner-city school, Firestone. <br/> <br/> This class is every bit as hard as any college course I have ever taken. You have to follow the syllabus because the teacher has put weeks of assignments ahead in Google Classroom. You are expected to find resources on your own to learn things you don't understand. You are supposed to schedule office hours appointments with the teacher.<br/> <br/> My kid is getting an A. Most students are having a very difficult experience. Yes. My kid is capable of learning the material. But most kids are. <br/> <br/> My kid is getting an A for one reason. Money. <br/> <br/> I have the time to work through this stuff every single day. And if I didn't, I would have hired a personal tutor. That's the only way most students are going to succeed in this class.</div><div></div></div>
