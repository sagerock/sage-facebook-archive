You might see them on the side of a street, often tied to a telephone pole. This one is in our yard. Our friend Hermaine Powell was shot to death right here. He was shot in the face, right around his left eye. 

A murder like that is an atomic bomb. It take the person and instantly splits him like an atom. One part transforms into beautiful, love and sorrow. Another part explodes into rage and anger and revenge. The split it so clear it feels like watching a Big Bang. Like a new universe being formed. 50% love. 50% hate. I feel so strongly that the universe must balance that way. I see no end to suffering. I see suffering as a constant force to allow love to come in. Suffering makes love (and makes more suffering). 

This is the cycle of life. I wish I had better news for you. But in some ways it is good news. As sure as suffering comes so will love and kindness.  Both are inevitable. 

I love you.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
