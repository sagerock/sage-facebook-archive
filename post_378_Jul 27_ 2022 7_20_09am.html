She drives that every day and has done so for decades. 

She now stops off at least once a week to make dinner and visit with her mother-in-law. Last night she grilled out for her. 

I often hear you say such kind and nice things about the work I do with homeless people. But here’s the thing: I only do exactly what I want to do. If I don’t want to go I don’t go. Sure. I find it to be meaningful work. But even that is just a selfish motivation for a seemingly gracious act. 

YOU ARE MY INSPIRATION. 

I don’t think I would make the effort to stop by my mother-in-law’s after a long day’s work to make dinner for her. I’m just so in awe of the effort my sister-in-law is making to help her mother-in-law who lives alone. 

I am in love with the new images from the James Webb space telescope. They are spectacular. But here’s the thing: It’s a human being that took those pictures. Without those humans doing this incredible work it’s like the universe wouldn’t even exist. 

I now believe we are the eyes and ears and awareness of the entire universe. The universe never got to experience itself until we came along. 

WE ARE THE UNIVERSE. We literally are made from the hearts of stars. And I see it everyday within you. 

I see the kindness of Jesus. 
I see the evil of Hitler. 
I see the love of a dog. 
I see the hate of a black hole. 
I see the sadness of a Holocaust survivor. 
I see the happiness of a child on Christmas morning. 

I SEE ALL THAT AND MORE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN YOU. 

I see the entire universe in you constantly. 

I just am so in love with you. I can’t get enough of you. 

What little I do to help my community I do in the name of you. I do it for you because you are as magnificent as 13.8 billion years of light and life.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
