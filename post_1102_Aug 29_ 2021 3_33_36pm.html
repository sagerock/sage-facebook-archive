But if you are drawn to immigrants and particularly the Afghans coming to Akron, I'm here to tell you: that is God talking to you. Get involved. Just show up and don't take no for an answer. International Institute of Akron is where you need to be. <br/> Most of all, they need money right now. Please donate if you can. AND THEN SHOW UP.</div><div></div></div>
