In fact, even more common is that a person illegally moves into a house and then sublets the house to his friends and collects rent. Then the actual owner finds out and tells everyone they have to leave. 

DO NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE. 

If you have personal belongings in a house you have tenant's rights. It is absolutely illegal for the owner to change the locks, remove your belongings, or turn off the utilities. You can sue them for doing any of these things.

They have to legally evict you. You need to be served papers. You likely will be able to stay in the house for 2-3 months while they do all that.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
