            <div class="_2pin"><div>Here's the home of an older lady, her daugher and their dog. They live by a dumpster between Red Roof Inn and Walmart on Arlington Road. <br/> <br/> Red Roof Inn costs $500/week. And they've already called Harvest Home and the Battered Women's Shelter. Both are full and not accepting anyone... not that they'd take them with their dog anyway. Access is ALWAYS full.<br/> <br/> In Akron, I'd say this dumpster is about as good as it gets for this lady. The city will just steal her tent if she puts it up somewhere. So  Happy Thanksgiving, Akron. We hate people who have lost everything and have no one. I'm not really sure how we live with ourselves.</div><div></div></div>
