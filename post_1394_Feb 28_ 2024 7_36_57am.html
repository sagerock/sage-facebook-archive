Today I want to talk about Reverend John Beaty, pictured here with Tara Mosely during her campaign for mayor. 

John is in his 80s. But he is as firey as any 20 year old activist you’d ever meet. His speeches at city council are fierce truth to power bombshells. You can feel the searing heat cut into each council member as he speaks. 

He spent the night with me in a tent on Christmas Eve in support of homeless pregnant women just as Mother Mary was when she was forced to give birth in a barn to a baby who some believe is the son of God. 

He has a wonderful, in-depth plan for tiny houses for homeless people that the administration should seriously consider. 

If there is a protest for oppressed people, more likely than not, John will be there walking and chanting with the people. 

If you know the street John lives on you can always find his house because he has multiple signs in his yard supporting oppressed people. 

He is always there for people who are abused, tortured and murdered by a cruel and careless system. He has done this work for decades. ￼

I care for the most severely tortured homeless people because they need the support. But it is people like John that give me the energy to keep going. 

Thank you Reverend Beaty. You deeply inspire me and keep me filled with passion and energy to never give up no matter how hopeless things seem sometimes.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
