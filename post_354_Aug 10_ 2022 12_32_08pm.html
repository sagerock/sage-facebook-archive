Homelessness can be a chronic condition like mental illness. It's sometimes something you fight with for life.

I'm James Nolan and my dog and I've been in a tent for two weeks now, and let's not forget about my now outdoor cat, because the dog says there's not enough room in the tent!! 
         My landlord, which lost his 1st two evictions that was not aloud, lawyered up and money talks! I was giving a time of ten days to move even though I asked for an extension....I'm on disability because of a severed spine, I had a stroke during the month I was being evicted which left me blind in my left eye, and I have a cat and a dog, but the courts couldn't allow to the 1st of the month. I had hundreds of dollars worth of food waisted but gave much of it away. The lot where I took haven is empty and don't belong to the landlord so cops didn't do anything since it's not his property. Other land owner hasn't complained</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
