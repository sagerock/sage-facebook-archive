            <div class="_2pin"><div>Remember that time God had it up to here with us humans and just flooded the whole damn place?<br/> <br/> I feel like that some days. <br/> <br/> Here I am hiding American citizens who were thrown out of their house. Nowhere they go now is legal. They can go to jail if they are caught sleeping literally anywhere. <br/> <br/> I walked through a holocaust ￼memorial the other day in Boston. It’s tragic and sad and infuriating. And here we are doing it again. It has a little twist now. We found that people don’t like us scooping up large portions of certain populations and putting them in concentration camps. So they found if they take everything away from the people they don’t like, in this case drug addicts, they fester and rot on the streets and then even the progressives will turn on them. <br/> <br/> WE NEVER LEARN.</div><div></div></div>
