            <div class="_2pin"><div>It is easy for us who are not caught up in the cult of a belief (Q Anon, Mormanisn, Evangelicalism, Scientology, Anti Vax, Science-ism, Capitalism, Socialism [see how you were nodding your head in agreement to whatever I was going to say until I called out your cult]{"THAT'S NOT A CULT!"}]) to see the holes in the belief that is not ours but to be blinded to the holes in our own beliefs.<br/> <br/> But I'm here to tell you, if you can't see the weaknesses in your beliefs then you are as clouded and immature in your growth and thinking as the person whom you love to chastise. <br/> <br/> The lesson is to grow while you're here on earth. And you grow by constructing, deconstructing and resurrecting.</div><div></div></div>
