I am forced to destroy a place￼ for Americans who have no shelter and nowhere else to go. It’s on a secluded piece of land owned by a church that wants to do this work. 

There is a veteran who lives here. He has done all the things he’s supposed to do. He’s lived in Valor Home. But all the people are too much for him. He prefers to live alone in a tent. We gave $40 billion to Ukrain, the city won’t let me shelter him on my land. HOW IS ANY OF THIS RIGHT?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
