She is extremely mentally ill. It’s very difficult to have meaningful conversations with her because she lives in such a different world. 

She has a chair in our basement where she sleeps. She doesn’t want to move to the main floor. She doesn’t want a cot or bed. She doesn’t even want a better chair. She just wants what she has. There is a small chair and a small end table next to the chair. That’s her world. That’s what she can rely on. 

On September 1 that will be wiped away. The city will declare the house condemned and everyone will be immediately required to vacate. They will get arrested if they stay. 

There is nothing for Chris. She won’t go to a congregate shelter. They wouldn’t put up with her yelling and swearing even if she did go. 

The city will take away her only shelter she knows. That’s “Mission Accomplished” for the city of Akron. They have done their good deed for the day by removing this woman from access to heat, running water, electricity and a warm place to sleep. That’s a success story for the city of Akron.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
