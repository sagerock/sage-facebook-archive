I was so taken by him. I have some great video of him that I'll be sharing soon. 

Ricky was one of 4 black men that were denied hotel vouchers by @[103601489691547:274:Community Support Services]. Because they have no addiction issues they were not eligible for a hotel. They were told to go to The Haven of Rest. Ricky cited religious differences, group showers with no privacy and lack of cleanliness and not being able to have his phone after lights out at 8pm. 

Ricky does not know where he is going to move. But he knows one thing, @[139561179458303:274:City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office] is coming for him and taking everything he owns.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
