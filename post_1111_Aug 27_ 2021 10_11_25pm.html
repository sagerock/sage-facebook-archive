            <div class="_2pin"><div>My friend offered to take 2 homeless people to get vaccinated and get the $100 gift cards. These are people that NEED money. They wouldn't do it. They honestly believe it's a government tracking program. <br/> They both have warrants. So they usually shy away from anything governmental. Food stamps. Medicaid. Etc. But I feel this was something over and above.</div><div></div></div>
