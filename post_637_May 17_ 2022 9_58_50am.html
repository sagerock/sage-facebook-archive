Why don't we put out dumpsters that people could just sleep in?"

The System: "That's beneath human dignity. We can't allow people to sleep in dumpsters."

Sage: "Um... but people are sleeping in dumpsters."

The System: "That's cruel. We need to get them out the dumpsters."

Sage: "Well where are you going to put them when you kick them out of the dumpsters?"

The System: "We have people we call for that."

(I honestly don't know where this is heading. People aren't allowed to sleep in boxes, tents, dumpsters or park benches. They are great at routing people out of those shelters. But they are terrible at offering them anything else.)</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
