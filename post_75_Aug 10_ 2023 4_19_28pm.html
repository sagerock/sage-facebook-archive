I just had a really good talk with a police officer. (I’ll talk more about that soon.)

Come to find out… someone was telling the police that Fox had a trapped door in his bedroom at our house where he held women hostage. 

This police officer friend of mine got to tour his room and the entire house. Guess what? NO TRAP DOOR!

That is beyond infuriating for me. 

Fox is no Boy Scout. But he spent more of his life in prison than he has free. He has had to walk these streets with the entire police force believing he is some sort of psychopathic woman torturer. 

How the hell does a guy fight against that headwind?

Again… I’ve got Fox stories. But nothing anywhere near as slanderous as what his “friends” were feeding to the police. 

Fox is leaving our house by Monday. Everyone is leaving except Cadillac. I’m probably moving in (more on that too). 

I’m sorry Fox. You don’t deserve that crap.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
