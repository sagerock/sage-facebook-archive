You like to think you would have. But you’re probably lying to yourself. The vast majority of people wouldn’t do it. And take it from a guy who shelters people that society hates: you have a million reasons why you wouldn’t want to risk your life to do it. And there is only one reason to do it: because it’s the right thing to do. 

All of human history has been filled with these kinds of tests. Will you do the right thing?

We usually fail these tests. 

Yet a few people DO pass the test. Miep Gies took in Anne Frank and her family. 

Otto Frank, her boss, asked her if she would help them and bring them food. Her answer: “Yes, of course.”

Miep writes: “We did our duty as human beings: helping people in need.”

It amuses me that we all know the tragic story of Anne Frank. But we are never taught the redemption story of Miep Gies. 

I believe that’s intentional. 

Anne Frank is used as a trauma triggering device the government can use at anytime to make us hate some random “enemy” the government is against. 

Miep Gies is nothing but a problem. If we all did our duty as human beings and helped people in need that would do nothing to propagate the agenda of the state. Helping people in need has nothing to do with advancing money and power. 

People like me and Miep Gies are not taught in schools. 

I will go to jail if I put one more tent on my land. You tell me what lesson the government is teaching.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
