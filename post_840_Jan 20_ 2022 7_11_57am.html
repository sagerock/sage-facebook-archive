            <div class="_2pin"><div>Do the right thing. <br/> <br/> My friend Kenny Boldt always preaches to me that wisdom. <br/> <br/> I've never met an organization or system that fully stays true to that commitment. <br/> <br/> Just yesterday I was at the health department getting needles. I was trying to pull a fast one on them. You are allowed to use fake information. So this week I tried to be another person so that I could get another 100 needles. (you are only allowed 100 every 2 weeks.) Our house had run out days ago. <br/> <br/> She recognized me and said I couldn't do that. She said I needed to bring my friends. I told her I had brought 5 people with me that day. <br/> <br/> She was the gatekeeper of the system. She could have "not recognized". But she did. <br/> <br/> This is not a slam on her or the health department. They are both amazing. All the health department cares about is keeping people safe. No judgement. Just safe. <br/> <br/> But even this amazing institution has protocol that you simply do not buck. <br/> <br/> This is merely a story about how even the most amazing, uncorrupted system I've ever worked with has limits to staying true to it's mission. <br/> <br/> But in actuality it's a juxtaposition to systems and to people. Kenny ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS taught me the truth of Do The Right Thing. <br/> <br/> A pregnant couple came to our house and garden desperately needing shelter. Josh Imler knew I had a rule about not accepting new people. Do you know what he did: he took care of them and gave them a tent. He was right. I was wrong. <br/> <br/> The people are always showing me the path. Always showing me the right way. <br/> <br/> Your community is the greatest "institution" you will ever be part of. My great wish for you is that you have as good a community as I do with my houseless friends and their supporters.</div><div></div></div>
