He was surrounded by friends at his home at 85 Kent Place in Akron. He had a heart attack. 

I was told by one of his friends (@[100027717561742:2048:Josh Sanders]) that earlier in the day he had come up to Josh and @[100031787131717:2048:Kenny Boldt] and stood and watched them working on a bike. Josh said he had a smile on his face like Josh had never seen before. He said it was such a smile that he saw a glow around John’s head. 

John lived in a tent at our tent city. And then he moved into our house. He lived there for several years until now. 

This picture was taken in February 2019 with my cousin @[1367602982:2048:Dana Gordon Matthews]. 

So many of you were such good friends to John. I’m so thankful for all of you. I know he was too.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
