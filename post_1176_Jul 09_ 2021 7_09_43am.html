(coffee was my daily gateway drug into the other 2.)

If you are fighting with these or any other addictions, this is my message:  you aren't bad, you aren't shameful, you aren't awful. MANY of us have been right where you are today. 

Maybe today is the day you change. Maybe it's tomorrow. But I know this: you can change if you want. But if you don't want to that's ok too.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
