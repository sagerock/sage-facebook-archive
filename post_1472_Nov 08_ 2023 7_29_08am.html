            <div class="_2pin"><div>I’m beyond pleased that we passed Issue 1 and 2. <br/> <br/> It represents a continuation of a populism we are seeing in both conservatives and progressive circles. <br/> <br/> I’m a happy social libertarian this morning. I am happy to see laws to protect the personal rights of individual people. <br/> <br/> With all that said, we must practice being good winners. Gloating creates pain and bitterness for the people who had hoped for different outcomes. <br/> <br/> It is proud and boastful winners that often keep the cycle of anger and bitterness churning. <br/> <br/> When our hearts are full with success and optimism it is an ideal time to practice compassion, empathy and understanding of people who think differently than ourselves. <br/> <br/> Our conservative brothers and sisters are so important to the fabric of our state and country. They grow our food, drive our ambulances, fight our fires, come running when we need protection and dutifully fight any war we deem necessary to fight. <br/> <br/> They don’t question whether something should be done. There job is their job and they do it to the best of their abilities every single time. <br/> <br/> And even more importantly, they bring stability and consistency to a world that could fly off the rails at any time. <br/> <br/> The truth is: abortion is a powerful tool that must be taken seriously. That “clump of cells” is scientifically 100% human. If we let it live what would it have chosen? To live to see what life has to offer? Or to be flushed down the toilet with no say in its existence?<br/> <br/> And marijuana is a serious drug. I’ve known people to slip into psychotic disorders like schizophrenia due to heavy use of pot. This too is a serious power we have been given. We must be open to the full truth and reality of this potent drug. <br/> <br/> Conservatives aren’t wrong. They aren’t stupid. They are just coming at problems from a different perspective.<br/> <br/> We ALWAYS come out stronger when we let all voices be heard. And when we win we must do the truly progressive thing and hold two contradictions in our mind at the same time. Opposite truths are often both right (and both wrong).<br/> <br/> We must listen to ALL people. Listening to people with whom we disagree are often the ones to give us the most important messages we need to hear right now. <br/> <br/> And let me say this about our new Akron Mayor: Shammas Malik. <br/> <br/> To have a young, Harvard-educated, Muslim as the mayor of our town is probably the most hopeful sign of progress I have seen in a very long time. <br/> <br/> Who knows how it’s going to turn out. He undoubtedly will face tremendous headwind from the old guard. But the symbolism of it all is incredibly powerful. <br/> <br/> Older people have value because they have experienced things that younger people can’t possibly appreciate. But that aged experience often is a perspective of muted hope and optimism resulting in less progress and less innovation. <br/> <br/> I’m very hopeful today for a future that values the rights and inherent worth of a much wider group of people. <br/> <br/> We have every right to be filled with hope and optimism this morning. Together we will solve all the world’s problems. I truly believe that’s the end goal of this game we call life. To figure out how to value everyone and leave no one behind.</div><div></div></div>
