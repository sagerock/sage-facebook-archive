            <div class="_2pin"><div>I believe there is a reason that we are all waking up to the reality that all our systems are failures. <br/> <br/> Your church won’t take you in when you’re homeless. <br/> Your police won’t rush in to save you when you are being murdered. <br/> Your hospital won’t take away your pain when you’re suffering. <br/> Your judges won’t uphold the law when it means going against their political interests. <br/> Your politicians won’t do anything other than save their own skin. <br/> <br/> WE ALL NOW KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. <br/> <br/> Why now? Why is all of this coming crashing in on us?<br/> <br/> It’s because we are ready. <br/> <br/> I’m not saying the systems should go away. Far from it. And we must always push them in whatever way necessary to be better. <br/> <br/> WHAT I AM SAYING IS: stop looking around when you see a problem. <br/> <br/> Stop waiting for someone else to take care of the homeless. <br/> <br/> Stop waiting for someone else to protect your neighborhoods. <br/> <br/> Stop waiting for someone else to feed the elderly and children. <br/> <br/> STOP WAITING for a knight in shining armor to ride up on a white horse to save the day. He’s not coming. YOU are the savior. <br/> <br/> And don’t expect to be thanked for it or appreciated for it. Expect the opposite. Expect the people you serve to take advantage of you. Expect the system to try to crush you. ”No good deed goes unpunished” is cosmic truth. You are disrupting the natural order of things. Nature wants to go back to disorder and chaos. (It’s the second law of thermodynamics.) HUMANS ARE THE CONSCIOUS WARRIORS AGAINST UNIVERSAL CHAOS. <br/> <br/> You are ready. You are our savior. You are the hero we need.</div><div></div></div>
