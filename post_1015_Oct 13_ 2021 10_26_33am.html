            <div class="_2pin"><div>My friend Tara L. Mosley has not only had her house shot up twice, she is now being accused of harboring a murderer at her house.<br/> <br/> Go fill your gossipy little brains with all the salacious details. You can find them out there. I'm not giving them to you.<br/> <br/> This is the fact and truth of the matter:<br/> <br/> "Following Edison's death, police looked for Lewis at his grandmother’s house on Seventh Avenue, where Akron Councilwoman Tara Samples also lives. Officers tried to enter the home but didn’t have a search warrant and say they couldn't get permission to come inside.<br/> <br/> Attorney Eddie Sipplen told the Beacon Journal that Samples called him after she located her nephew. Sipplen arranged for Lewis to peacefully turn himself over to police on July 6, one day after the killing."<br/> <br/> Her house was shot on July 5 and October 5, 2021.<br/> <br/> WHAT WE DON'T KNOW:<br/> We don't know why her house has been targeted. We know that she is very outspoken about gun violence in her neighborhood. (Drug dealers are brutal terrorists and would easily do this with no remorse.)<br/> <br/> But here is what we do know:<br/> As a middle-class white man, if I said, "Hey, my nephew is in my house, I need some time to convince him to turn himself in," I would have been given all the time in the world to do so.<br/> <br/> As a black woman, Tara is being accused of harboring a murderer in her house WITH ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF. I'm telling you: there are different rules in America for black people and white people.<br/> <br/> So, now she not only has to deal with the severe trauma of being a target by murderers, she has to deal with being found guilty in the court of public opinion for harboring a murderer WHICH WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF OF. <br/> <br/> And, let me add... where ever her nephew was for one night, TARA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONVINCING HIM TO TURN HIMSELF IN.<br/> <br/> Stop being so cruel and little. Tara is a neighbor of ours. For God's Sake, find some love and compassion in your heart. She is the victim here. Stop convicting her of something you have no proof of.</div><div></div></div>
