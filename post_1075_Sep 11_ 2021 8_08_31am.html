            <div class="_2pin"><div>I am strongly against the government mandating vaccinations. (Although I also strongly believe everyone that can get vaccinated should get vaccinated.)<br/> <br/> Why would I believe all drugs should at least be decriminalized, sex work should be legalized and abortions should be legal until at least the baby is viable, and then turn around and support the government forcing people to get vaccinated?<br/> <br/> I try very hard to be consistent and unhypocritical. <br/> <br/> The government should stay the hell out of our personal lives.</div><div></div></div>
