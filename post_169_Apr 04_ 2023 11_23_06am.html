This is Mohamed Reeda. He was arrested Thursday at his home on three counts of rape, two counts of abduction and one count of attempted rape.

Detectives said they've identified eight victims so far from throughout Akron from November 2022 until March 2023, with additional charges expected to be filed against Reeda. Police said they believe there could be additional victims who didn't report to police.

According to Akron Municipal Court records, the incidents Reeda is charged with happened on Feb. 3, 2023, on East Exchange Street; Feb. 28, 2023, on Morgan Avenue; and Sept. 20, 2022, on Arlington Street.
