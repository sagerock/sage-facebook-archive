            <div class="_2pin"><div>So... Thanksgiving. <br/> If, by now, you aren't aware that this holiday is challenging you either are living in another universe than the rest of us, or you are exhibiting selective ignorance racism.<br/> <br/> Did we inflict genocide on the original owners of this land? Yes. Did we steal the land that was never ours to begin with? Yes. Are Native Americans suffering and mostly forgotten while the rest of us stuff our faces with FAR too much food. Yes. <br/> <br/> But I'm a believer in reform. I think nearly everything can be reformed. <br/> <br/> It's not to late to change the path we're on. (and no, acknowledging the land you are the benefactor of due to a bloody, violent theft does not suffice at all.)<br/> <br/> We are being screamed at by the universe to wake up and fix this cruel heartless system some of us benefit from so much while MANY others starve and freeze. <br/> <br/> Be thankful AND change the system. It falls to YOU. Stop looking around. YOU have to fix the system.</div><div></div></div>
