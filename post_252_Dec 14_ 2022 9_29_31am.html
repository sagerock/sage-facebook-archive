Tara Mosely had actual frightening white racists terrorizing her at her house and nothing was done.

But 2 weeks ago a bunch of white people thought they heard Reverend Ray Greene say something he ABSOLUTELY DID NOT SAY and we now have a new law rushed through that will give automatic jail time to people who someone is going to determine was "menacing" to city workers. (I guarantee it will mostly be applied to Black men.)

(I put City Councilman Russ Neal on this picture as well as Reverend Ray Greene to remind you that Russ has been censored because 6 anonymous women accused him of scaring them during covid when everyone was all working online. Russ was the only person to vote against this bill because I'm sure he knew exactly what this was about.)

Akron started as a racist city and is still as racist as ever.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
