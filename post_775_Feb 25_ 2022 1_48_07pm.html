We went from having a freezing cold house to a toasty warm house. 

Our brand new furnace is already in. 

If there is one message I want you to know it is that PEOPLE ARE GOOD. 

I found out we needed a new furnace at about 8am this morning. It's now 1:45 and we have a new furnace. That's great. But it's not the best part. 

I told you about this situation and put up a fundraiser to raise the $2500 for the furnace. And just look what you did in that short amount of time:

You fill me with hope and love and faith. You are awe inspiring. Thank you.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
