I was told by the cop on the case if we all stood up against him he couldn't take us all at once.

I was left to smooth all that shit over with this guy who knew I called the police. Nothing ever happened to him. (on top of that, when I let the guy talk to the cop on his phone, the cop called me back and yelled at me for giving this guy his personal cell phone number.)

I WILL NEVER CALL THE POLICE AGAIN unless it's to clean up a crime scene.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
