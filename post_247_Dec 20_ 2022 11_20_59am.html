People have slept out with me before. I really wish you wouldn't. It's not safe. And it is going to be 7 degrees. I CANNOT TAKE CARE OF YOU IN ANY WAY. 

But I would LOVE if you would stop by and come visit me. 

And, if you want, you can bring hats, gloves, hand warmers, zero degree sleeping bags, tents and tarps that I will give out to my homeless friends.

I love you. And stay strong.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
