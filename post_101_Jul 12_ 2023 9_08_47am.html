My neighbors and the police were fed up with the loud music, the wire burning, and all the other ridiculous stuff that went on at our house. 

He looked at me and said: “this isn’t my first eviction. You can’t board up this house.”

As the police were standing outside of the house helping me remove people who were randomly living in the house, another man called the police on the police. And you know what: it worked. They called the prosecutor’s office and they said that I needed to do an eviction. 

Look at this man. He’s physically awesome. And he’s smart too. 

He’s charged at me twice. AND HE’S ONE OF THE SANE AND RATIONAL ONES. I can work with him because his brain functions normally. 

We have left these people to fight for their survival on the streets and in the prisons. And then we expect them to just line up like little ducklings and get a 40 hour job and pay $1000/month in rent. 

They aren’t the insane ones. It’s all of us tacitly supporting the war on drugs, the war on homelessness and the war on poverty. WE have created this nightmare. Not them. 

And I truly believe it’s starting to blow back on the rich people.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
