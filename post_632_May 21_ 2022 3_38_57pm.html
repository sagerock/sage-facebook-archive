            <div class="_2pin"><div>I have thought A LOT about the solution to extreme drug use and extreme mental disorders. I believe there are only 3 solutions available today:<br/> <br/> Extermination<br/> Incarceration<br/> Tent villages and tiny house villages<br/> (And incarceration is probably not even realistic because we've stuffed our jails and prisons full of actual criminals. And I don't see anyone talking about insane asylums these days.)<br/> <br/> Everything else is a pipe dream that will take WAY more money and WAY more political will than anyone is willing to spend in today's political climate.</div><div></div></div>
