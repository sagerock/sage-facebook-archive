Card, a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, had recently reported experiencing mental health issues, including hearing voices, and threatened to shoot up a military base. 

And then he ends up killing 18 people. 

In America it’s really hard to get mental health treatment even when you want it. 

We have these insane monsters running around all of America and we are left to fend for ourselves out here with them. 

I don’t care if you are insane and not hurting anyone. If you want to not get treatment that’s cool with me. Even if you are suicidal. That’s your business. But when you have people who have explicitly shown they are violent AND have weapons that’s an entirely different story.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
