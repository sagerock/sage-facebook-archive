BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU: Akron men, women and children cannot find housing in their own city. AMHA vouchers are expiring left and right because there is a limited supply of housing.

And eviction rates are expected to meet or exceed levels before COVID when Akron was the #1 city for most evictions in Ohio.

BUT WATCH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN: Our current mayor is going to put out a press release soon to let you know how excited he is that we will be taking a couple hundred Ukrainian refugees into Akron.

These immigrants will move to the front of the bus as multi-generational Akronites get pushed to the back.

HE'S EXCITED because his entire plan is to push poor people out of Akron and get "reputable" people in his city.
