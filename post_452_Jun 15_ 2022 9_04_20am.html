He was the first person to use our new outdoor sink with running water. 

THE VERY FIRST thing he did was take this bag, put holes in it and make a shower. 

The city will probably say a sink is not allowed outside. But whatever. Today could be the hottest day in history.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
