JUST TODAY I was having a conversation about a mentally ill homeless friend of mine who shouts threats and racial epithets. 

Homeless people and mentally ill people are usually more of a danger to themselves than other people. 

A HUGE problem in America today is our seriously lacking mental health situation. 

I started researching how to buy Depacote online without a prescription for this homeless friend of mine to try to treat his psychotic episodes due to bipolar disorder. It's that bad. 

I would not be at all surprised to learn that Rosenbaum had stopped taking his prescribed meds which actually creates WORSE mental illness if taken off too quickly.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
