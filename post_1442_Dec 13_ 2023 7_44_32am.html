For as long as I’ve known Jack he has housed some of the most difficult homeless people in his house at 1225 Miriam Street. 

There’s a great story of a man he housed that would get drunk and just become completely crazed. At one point he poured his beer into the electronics of the furnace and completely destroyed the furnace. 

There are many people who are very thankful for the kindness, generosity and hospitality of Jack White. 

A year or so ago there was an electrical fire above Jack’s bedroom. It didn’t destroy the entire house. But it was just enough that he couldn’t get it fixed. 

The city condemned his house and would arrest anyone who tried to sleep in it. 

Jack is now living on the street homeless.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
