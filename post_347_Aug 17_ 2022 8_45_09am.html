He’s a veteran. 

He was angry when I spoke to him because someone just had told him to call veteran services. He said he’s no longer allowed on their property. 

There are MANY people who live in this limbo space where they aren’t in jail and they have been banned from services. (And please don’t pile on with your “helpful”, judgmental, condescending advice about how he’s not trying hard enough. You don’t know this guy.)

Even if he’s “not trying hard enough” what do we do with people that haven’t done anything illegal yet are wandering around without services? (Most of my homeless friends have no IDs and therefore no food card or medical access.) What do we do with people like this? Because they are everywhere.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
