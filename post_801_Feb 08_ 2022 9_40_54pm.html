Someone saves his life with Narcan and he's pissed you ruined the best high of his life. <br/> <br/> Alcohol. <br/> He will get in a bar fight, will rape a hooker and will tie his wife and kids to the bed and burn the entire house down with them in it, all in the same night. <br/> <br/> How'd I do?</div><div></div></div>
