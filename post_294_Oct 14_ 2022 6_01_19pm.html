            <div class="_2pin"><div>A homeless, seriously mentally ill (and violent) young man went back to his family this summer near Youngstown. They asked for him to come home. <br/> <br/> Yesterday they dropped him back off in Akron. Like a stray dog. <br/> <br/> He has absolutely nothing.<br/> <br/> He refuses to see a psychiatrist. He says all he needs is God. (It turns out God is a shitty psychiatrist.)<br/> <br/> This is a bad situation.</div><div></div></div>
