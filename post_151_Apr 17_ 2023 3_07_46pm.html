I am so sorry for what might be coming. What likely will be coming.

Can anyone, who isn't Black, imagine the pain, and suffering and heartache of Black Americans? 

It's not right by any conceivable imagination the way we have abused the Black community of Akron and the United States, for ever.

Why can't we do better than this? Isn't America better than this? Aren't we supposed to be better than this? Can't we at least try to be better than this?

At the very least, can we please admit that Black people suffer in a unique way, unlike any other people in America. It's called systemic racism. But if you can't handle that word call it stereotyping. Call it Black hate. Call it racial injustice. Call it whatever you want. But please acknowledge that there is something to this idea. All Black people suffer in a way unlike any other group of people in the United States of America.

Please try to find a small place in your heart to hold the generational sadness of the Black community. 

Please. Just try to be kind for a little bit. This is a suffering wound that won't heal. 

I am as sorry for the Black American community as I am about anything else in America. 

I am so so deeply sorry.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
