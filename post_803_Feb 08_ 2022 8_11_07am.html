(Of course low income people can't read it because they don't have extra money to afford to read the newspaper. PEOPLE ON FOOD STAMPS SHOULD GET FREE ACCESS TO THE NEWSPAPER). 

It comes down to poverty. If you are poor you show up to school less. 

Akron's current government is focusing on rich people. We need to be focusing on poor people. Because when rich people read these articles there is no way in hell they are moving to Akron. 

Dr. Bob from Akron's own AA taught us about having a sponsor. Everyone (and I mean everyone) needs a life sponsor. Please think about being a mentor to someone, ANYONE. And commit to them. They will fail. They will dishearten you. But that's when they need you the most. 

The greatest gift you can give to the world is commit to loving one person deeply and fully.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
