Sometimes she’s called Crazy Chris. But she is well known in Middlebury. She roams the streets all day. She sleeps in a metal upright chair in our house at night. 

Kristen, from our house, looks after her. She has offered her a cot or a more comfortable chair. She just wants the chair she has. 

She gets a check. I think she spends most of her money on drugs. I’ve never see her eat or drink. (She must. But I’ve never seen it.)

There are going to be some institutional people that will say this is “tragic.”

But is it? 

Would we rather take away her freedom and lock her up in some hospital because someone decided for her that she isn’t living right?

Most animals crave freedom. And Chris isn’t hurting anyone. 

And if you’re so concerned about her then get on the street and become her friend. No, those people are primarily motivated by getting her money. Not doing what Chris wants.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Middlebury/978461538854606" target="_blank">Middlebury</a> (41.071918, -81.488393)</div><div>Address: Middlebury, OH 44305</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
