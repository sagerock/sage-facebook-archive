That's why we have a judicial system. I will say that it doesn't look awesome for him.<br/> <br/> But I hate this shit. It's always like this. Bill Clinton having "sexual relations with that woman." Hunter Biden and his laptop. Hillary Clinton and her emails. Trump grabbin' them by the pussy. <br/> <br/> ALL OF IT IS AN INTENTIONAL DISTRACTION TO KEEP US NOT TALKING ABOUT THE REAL PROBLEMS.<br/> <br/> Corporations control our politicians with massive lobbying and campaign donations. <br/> We gave away all our job first to China and Mexico and now to the machines. <br/> We can't afford to live in our own cities any more because developers price fix the cost of living.<br/> Cops are murdering unarmed Black kids.<br/> Psychopathic White men are murdering our kids in schools.<br/> <br/> AND NO ONE IS DOING A GODDAMN THING ABOUT ANY OF IT.<br/> <br/> But sure. Let's talk about Trump some more.</div><div></div></div>
