            <div class="_2pin"><div>I try not to attack Republican ideologies too much. I have more than enough material on the Left side of things. BUT...<br/> <br/> Republicans aren't Libertarians any more. That whole "Don't Tread on Me" idea is a total lie. <br/> <br/> They don't care what happens to women, Black people, addicted people, felons, poor people or any minority. "Don't Tread on Me" only applies when it's something that a white man wants: Guns, abortion, Christianity everywhere, only Western education. <br/> <br/> I am more than willing to fight for all those things for you, AS LONG AS, at the very least, you don't tread on my life and values.</div><div></div></div>
