            <div class="_2pin"><div>MY SECOND EXPERIENCE WITH DE-ESCALATION WITH A GUN<br/> <br/> I was sitting inside my building yesterday when a homeless friend came to me and said there was a man with a gun who was extremely agitated at our house. <br/> <br/> I went to see what was going on. <br/> <br/> As I slowly walked towards the scene I watched as this man ranted and paced around aggressively in front of the door of our house. I didn’t recognize him right away. He wasn’t a person who was a regular. <br/> <br/> As I got closer someone near the scene told me who it was. I then recognized him. He was upset about a rumor he heard. <br/> <br/> As I got to him I noticed he didn’t have 1 gun. He had 2. One gun was in his left sweatpants pocket. And the other gun was in his right hoodie pocket. <br/> <br/> He would occasionally touch the left hand gun from outside his pants pocket. <br/> <br/> As he and I were talking he was getting more agitated. He wanted information of a specific location that we all knew. But given the circumstances we didn’t want to tell him because it was a location of a small camp of homeless people. <br/> <br/> He kept getting more and more agitated. It was just me and him talking. Others were calmly milling around like it was a normal day. Drama like this isn’t an everyday thing for these people. But it’s also not uncommon. <br/> <br/> He seemed to be getting angrier and angrier. So I put my hand on my gun which was on my back right hip under my coat. I had taken the safety off as I had walked to the scene. <br/> <br/> He kept pacing and ranting. <br/> <br/> He finally said, “what do you have your hand on? I’ve been shot before.”<br/> <br/> He then took his left hand gun out of his pants pocket. I was trying to notice how old the gun was. How reliable was it going to be if he fired it?<br/> <br/> This was the moment I had to make a very serious decision. <br/> <br/> I said, “Look man. Just put your gun away.”<br/> <br/> I took my hand off my gun and held my hand in the air. <br/> <br/> He put his gun back in his pocket. I asked him to take his hand off his gun. He did. <br/> <br/> I told him I’d help him find the answers to his questions. <br/> <br/> He was still angry. But he got in the passenger side of the car he came in. <br/> <br/> They drove off. <br/> <br/> *********<br/> <br/> I have a couple thoughts about this situation. <br/> <br/> First, I’ve had a gun drawn on me before. It doesn’t scare me. I believe I have a broken fear switch. <br/> <br/> I’m not scared. I’m not excited. I don’t feel anything different at all. <br/> <br/> You might as well be talking about the weather to me. <br/> <br/> But I am constantly assessing the situation. Who’s around me? What could I do to take cover? How is everyone else feeling and acting? Do I need to calm them down? What’s my escape route?<br/> <br/> Then it’s just me and the person having a conversation. <br/> <br/> My goal is to just move on to the next step. What does this person want? How can I help them get it?<br/> <br/> I’m not there to take this person into custody. I’m not there to take his gun. I’m just there to help move beyond this point. <br/> <br/> I don’t know if I’m doing it right. I just am making this stuff up on the fly. I have never been trained in de-escalation. <br/> <br/> Honestly, I think this is probably what most people do in these situations. For every encounter where someone ends up shot I bet there are 100 where it resolves this way. This kind of thing is just not that uncommon in our neighborhoods. Guns are everywhere. <br/> <br/> I think where it goes wrong is when an agitated person meets an immovable wall like another agitated person… or a police officer. <br/> <br/> Police are stuck in a bad spot. There is no way they can let a person like this walk away. So they have to go the other way. They can’t de-escalate like I did. They have to figure out how to control this person and take him into custody.  I’d probably do it a lot like how they do it if I were in their shoes. <br/> <br/> I don’t know exactly what my lessons are here. But maybe its more about teaching de-escalation to the community. To the people. If you don’t want the police involved then you’re going to have to handle it yourself. Maybe we offer defense training and de-escalation training regularly in our communities. <br/> <br/> If either I or the person I was talking to got shot yesterday it would have been all bad. It would have torn our community apart. <br/> <br/> In the last situation I was in like this I ended up buying the gun from the person. I felt like he was going to be a recurring problem. In this situation I feel like this was a one off thing. I’m not worried it’s going to happen again. <br/> <br/> In this situation it was all just a misunderstanding. It was cleared up and all is right with the world.</div><div></div></div>
