            <div class="_2pin"><div>LOW INCOME BY CHOICE<br/> <br/> A highly educated woman friend of mine used that phrase when talking with me recently. I think she’s low income by choice to be with her kids. <br/> <br/> What do you think? Is that an acceptable choice to make?<br/> <br/> I imagine most of you would say that it’s fine if you are paying all your bills and taking care of all your responsibilities. <br/> <br/> My mom was low income by choice. She was the suspension monitor at Medina High School for most of my childhood so that she could be home when I got home. Our utilities were almost always in risk of being shut off. They were shut off several times while I was growing up. We rented a room to a woman for 10 years who gradually became an increasingly problematic alcoholic. She hit the house one time with her car. She’d bring these super wierd guys over to the house. <br/> <br/> A homeless friend of mine makes about $60-$80 a week doing odd jobs. He like to smoke cigarettes. He currently isn’t smoking meth. But when he does it’s about a $40/week activity. <br/> <br/> I know a single mom with a special needs kid. She works part time to be home with her kid and sells drugs on the side. <br/> <br/> Is it ok to live in a tent or your car because you want to be low income by choice?</div><div></div></div>
