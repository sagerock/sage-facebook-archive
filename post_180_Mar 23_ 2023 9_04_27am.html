I've been to each door TWICE. And I'm about to start my third round. 

I've ridden 372 miles on my bike for this campaign so far. I'll get well over 500 before it's all over. 

My brakes have given out in a rainstorm as I was barreling down Halifax toward Market.

Multiple times, I've been nearly plowed off the street trying to get to voters on Ridgewood.

I messed up my back tripping on a broken sidewalk which is an epidemic in Ward 8.

Oh! And one poor lady was so upset seeing my face that when she opened the door she screamed "NO!" and quickly shut and locked her door. 

And I've had some of the most engaging and wonderful conversations with truly thoughtful and caring people here in Ward 8. 

I. WILL. NOT. QUIT. 

I feel like there is a real possibility I could win this. But it is going to be tough. My opponent has WAY more money and endorsements from all the bigwigs in town. The ONLY way I can win is with your help. 

Will you help me win this thing? 

I am looking for some friends to join my volunteer text group here:
https://tapme.ws/Xo1euf

Most of what I'll ask is online stuff. And you can just take a pass on any of it. But I'd love it so much if you'd be open to joining that group and listening to some ideas to help win.

Thank you SO much for all your support. You are amazing.
