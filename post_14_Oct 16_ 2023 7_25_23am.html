This was taken November 21, 2021. So many people have come and gone. All desperately trying to find a finger hold of existence. All swept away by the government into nowhere. 

CJ recently left a house given to him by Community Support Services. He says people were shooting AK-47s around him. He is currently under a bridge with a tarp and blanket provided by you. 

I have sheltered CJ in multiple tents, a tiny house and our now-condemned house. In every instance he believed people were coming for him. Sneaking into his room, blowing hair and other creepy things into his space. 

He believes people are burning wire next to him in his current space. 

CJ is haunted. Nowhere is safe. I’ve never met anyone with such a constant level of fear. I usually can help a person find a space of, at least momentary, peace and refuge. CJ always is on the run.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
