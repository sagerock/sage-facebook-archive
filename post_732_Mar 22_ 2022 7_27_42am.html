            <div class="_2pin"><div>TRASH<br/> <br/> The Beacon Journal article about how understaffed and under funded Keep Akron Beautiful is, has been weighing heavily on me. <br/> <br/> I work more in trash removal than anything else I do in the homeless community. <br/> <br/> I feel like trash is the physical manifestation of a mind that has been broken by a lifetime of trauma, sorrow, and hopelessness. <br/> <br/> If we want to begin the healing of Akron we must deal with the trash. <br/> <br/> #sageformayor</div><div></div></div>
