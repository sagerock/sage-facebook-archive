(if you don't have money you probably are on the list.)<br/> <br/> And the way we right it in our minds is that we demonize and pathologize them for their barbaric actions.  Their addictions. Their crimes. <br/> <br/> But it's all because everyone knows they are garbage humans that they act antisocially. We started it by being anti-them.</div><div></div></div>
