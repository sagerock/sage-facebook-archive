            <div class="_2pin"><div>There were 2 really insightful interactions on my podcast this morning. <br/> <br/> The first one was from my friend James J Nolan who wrote: "I have money for rent but my dog likes the tent." He is literally choosing to live in a tent.<br/> <br/> And then Shannon Wilson dropped these bombs of wisdom:<br/> "It's a choice to live free from typical social constraints."<br/> "It's our true primal nature."<br/> <br/> What do you think: Should people have the right to live in a tent in a city?</div><div></div></div>
