We had 5 people come into our camp and violently beat up 3 people. I called the police. They said there was nothing they could do. BUT they wanted a couple of our residents to rat out another homeless person. That will not be happening. 

Do cops honestly wonder why people won't talk to them?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
