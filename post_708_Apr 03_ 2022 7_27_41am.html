            <div class="_2pin"><div>I think it's worth spending time trying to deeply understand the people who are concerned about sexual identity in schools and American society as a whole. <br/> <br/> Our gender is foundational to everything. If gender didn't matter we wouldn't be having this conversation at all. How we identify sexually matters deeply to us personally and as how we fit into society. <br/> <br/> When a person who looks like a man says they identity as a woman it is like a shift in plate tectonics. It's very confusing and disorienting to half of the population of America. <br/> <br/> I think we must recognize that the half of our society that helps us maintain stability and structure so that we don't all just spin off into the ether, find this all hard to grasp. I think I can understand why they are worried. <br/> <br/> Their concerns are not unwarranted. Structure is very important for us all to live together peacefully. <br/> <br/> I really believe we have to sit with them and listen and not offer counterpoint. Until they truly feel heard and understood we will never be able to move the needle one inch forward together.</div><div></div></div>
