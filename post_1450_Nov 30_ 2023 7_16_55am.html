This is at the Family Dollar in Middlebury. 

I feel like I’m seeing more people sleeping in open areas like this. 

That is because the city of Akron is aggressively, quickly and quietly sweeping camps in the woods. People lose all their belongings and then they end up like this guy. 

Chinese President Xi Jinping recently came to San Francisco and the city made a large portion of the homeless population just disappear. Republicans praised the change. And Democratic leaders took note.

I believe we are going to see a return to the Rudy Giuliani approach of just making homeless people disappear.

Of course they won’t actually just magically vanish. They’ll live hiding in abandoned houses, sleeping in garages, walking the streets all night long. 

I think life is going to get worse for American homeless people. We clearly care about literally everything more than them. We only care about how annoying and gross they are.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://facebook.com/100068738108194" target="_blank">Mattress factory outlet</a> (41.07254, -81.49032)</div><div>Address: 5 N ARLINGTON, Akron, OH 44305</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
