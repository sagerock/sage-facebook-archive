            <div class="_2pin"><div>In low-income communities in a city, IN GENERAL, women boost (they steal from stores) and men scrap metal. Copper wire is the ultimate prize. They burn off the outer coating of the wire so that it pays more. <br/> <br/> They are all making about $10-$40 a day. <br/> <br/> Most people refuse to fly a sign for money. They find it too degrading. Those people make about $20-$40 a day. <br/> <br/> As we continue to stabilize our tent community (we had a really good week this past week. We just need to keep stringing good weeks together) my idea is to create piecework jobs where a person gets paid per thing they make. I'm thinking like jewelry and t-shirts. <br/> <br/> If I can get to a point where I'm offering a job that pays $20-$40 a day whenever a person needs it I could stop the stealing, scrapping (which is often stealing) and panhandling.</div><div></div></div>
