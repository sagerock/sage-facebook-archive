You can see very clearly the threat that he is making here. This guy hates homeless people. It is incredibly dangerous to be a person with no home in the United States of America. These people are violently hated by many other people. It’s the kind of hate that is reminiscent of Nazi Germany. If these people disappeared into some sort of concentration camps there would be a significant percentage of Americans that would be glad that it happened. 

We must always remember that the genocidal hate of humanity is right under the surface. We can never pretend that we have eliminated hate based on race, gender, family status and now, very significantly, monetary status.￼￼￼ We all must be brave to publicly stand up for people that other people would like to see dead.￼</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
