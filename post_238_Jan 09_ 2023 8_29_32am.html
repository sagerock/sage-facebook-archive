I am going to ask for 3 things from you before this City Council Primary is over on May 2, 2023. 

If you believe in Democracy, if you would like to see me in Akron City Council to stand up for the people of Akron in a way that's never been done before, THEN I NEED YOUR HELP. 

No politician can win an election in a Democracy without help from the people. Democracy is hard. But if you love freedom you need to be part of the process.

ASK NUMBER 1: I need signatures for my Petition to be a candidate on the ballot. They need to live in Ward 8 in Akron. And they need to be a Democrat (or an Independant). I need between 25-75 signatures by February 1. 

Doing this is not a vote for me. It's just allowing me to be on the ballot. This is how Democracy works. If you want more choices to vote for then you need to help people get on a ballot.

IF YOU LIVE IN WARD 8 OR YOU KNOW SOMEONE IN WARD 8, PLEASE SIGN MY PETITION. I will come to you. All you have to do is open your door when I knock and sign your name. 

It costs no money. It is not an endorsement of me. It is not a vote for me. ALL it is is giving people the opportunity to have another person to vote for. 

PLEASE let me know if I can come get your signature. Or PLEASE ask a friend of yours if they live in Ward 8 to let me come get their signature.

I also can register people to vote. If you know of a young person that isn't registered to vote I would love to register them. And then they can sign my petition as well.

THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
