He never had really had a chance. He went into juvenile detention at age 12 and was never out longer than 18 months ever since. 

His parents fell into drugs. The brothers were left to fend for themselves. What would you do? What would you do if you were all alone at age 12 growing up on 5th Avenue in East Akron?

Do you like to think you’d sell newspapers and apples on the street corner like you see in Mary Poppins and Willy Wonka? Maybe he should have become a chimney sweep so your childish fantasies of inner city poverty could stay intact. 

What actually happens is that you desperately look for another family. And the gangs are right there to “take care of you.”

And what’s worse than that? It’s that the system, organized mostly by lying Democrats, is fanning the flames of this extermination process. 

Why are inner city streets filled with abandoned houses that are illegal to sleep in while drug addicted mentally ill people have to sleep in the woods unsheltered because the Democrats stole their tents?

And now here come the immigrants. These people are super hard workers. They desperately want a better opportunity at life. They are incredible with their wonderful food and “can do” attitudes. Who do you want? A highly educated asylum seeker from South America? Or Jay?

The unemployment rate is too low. Capitalism only works if about 3%-5% of the population desperately wants to work but can’t find a job. 

“The system works,” as Akron mayor Dan Horrigan once defiantly said in a video condemning my work with people like Jay. 

If we would just turn our backs on people like Jay and shun them like both Democrats and Republicans want, they would die sooner (hopefully before they breed) and we can Make America Great again which is real truth and plan architected by the rich corporate rulers on both sides of the isle. 

My full interview of Jay is on my YouTube channel.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
