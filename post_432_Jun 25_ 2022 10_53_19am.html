They said it is a Sheriff issue. That's where sex trafficking cases are investigated.<br/> <br/> I have never spoken with a sheriff. The 2 people who would have most likely been the people who would have done this have not been contacted by the police or the sheriff's office on this.<br/> <br/> One of these people has been in and out of Summit County Jail twice this last week on unrelated things. They never talked to that person about it.<br/> <br/> The other person has 2 old misdemeanors on their record having to do with drug possession. <br/> <br/> I am always here to talk with anyone on this topic. If there was sex trafficking I want to know about it and I want it prosecuted.<br/> <br/> In other news... Anastasia did not shoot anyone in the face or anywhere else.<br/> <br/> That is all.</div><div></div></div>
