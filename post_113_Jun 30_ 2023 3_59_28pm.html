This is the bigger one in we stayed in. Our first capsules were double deckers. 

Homelessness has increased 9% in LA this year even though they spend over $1 billion annually on the issue. 

They will tell you the problem is that there isn’t enough housing. And then they try to solve the problem by building $600,000 units to give to homeless people. 

We are too embarrassed to admit we need slums. We need tent compounds. We need micro apartments. 

Because we’re too ashamed of our poverty problem we won’t do anything at all. So we end up with masses of people roaming our streets with nowhere to go.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
