He strangled a woman in front of Acme. I had called the police on him for throwing things and yelling at drivers. Many people called on him. But, as is the way it is in America, he only got picked up after trying to kill someone.

I don't find him on the roster. He's probably already out. But I did find my friend Trae.

He's in jail for drug possession. What a complete waste of resources. Trae, and Dwayne, have one problem: UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. 

Trae, like so many of my friends, self-medicates with meth. They find that it calms them down. They can't get help from the mental health industry so they turn to street pharmacists. 

Some people think that me sheltering people with a tent is just enabling drug addiction. All I'm doing is picking up the slack from the totally failed American mental health system. OF COURSE, there are going to be people living in tents. What else could you possibly expect in America?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
