            <div class="_2pin"><div>I am deeply sorry that Tara L. Mosley home has been shot multiple times. Thankfully she is safe. <br/> <br/> I'm sick of the police chastising us for not ratting out the terrorists in our communities. <br/> <br/> This is a problem of inequality, racism, oppression and hopelessness. <br/> <br/> It is not Tara's responsibility as a citizen to be Batman and turn in murderers. SHE AND HER NEIGHBORS ARE THE FUCKING VICTIMS!<br/> <br/> It is the responsibility of white business owners and white middle class people, who have been given so much in America, to offer a hand up to the inner city youth of America. That is the only way we will ever move on from this cycle of death and destruction.</div><div></div></div>
