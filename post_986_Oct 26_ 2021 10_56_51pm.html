According to this inerrant word of God USA is the greatest country in the world?"<br/> <br/> Is it the ridiculously expensive healthcare?<br/> Is it the nuke stockpile big enough to destroy the earth multiple times over?<br/> Maybe it's because we are the only country to ever use nuclear weapons on another country...and we did it TWICE.<br/> Is it the 37,000 homeless veterans?<br/> Is it the genocide of the natives who were living here first?<br/> Was it the chattel slavery?<br/> Is it the largest prison population in the world?<br/> <br/> I literally can't figure it out. <br/> <br/> It's the obscene amount of money and the fact that corporations don't pay taxes, isn't it?</div><div></div></div>
