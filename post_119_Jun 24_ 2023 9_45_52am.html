I hadn’t seen him in a while because he was in jail for a bit. 

But he’s out and he’s doing GREAT! Sober. Happy. Living in Cleveland. Working with veteran services. He lived in our Red House for a while. 

He’s also taking classes to be a peer advisor for drug recovery. 

Jail can sometimes work for kickstarting recovery. My feeling is that any program that has a 10% success rate is worthwhile. I think I’ve seen about that amount of success for jail. 

But I also think there are certain people that can do better using jail as a form of recovery. Unc doesn’t exhibit any serious mental illness issues. And he has income for being a veteran. 

Most people who I know that come out of jail have less than the nothing they had when they went in. So changing your life is all but impossible. 

I’m so happy for Unc. He’s an amazing guy.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
