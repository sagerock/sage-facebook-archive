Mosley].

Tara was Dennis' running mate in his recent bid for being Ohio's governor. 

During the campaign he said he was going to turn the governor's mansion into a homeless shelter if he won. I got to talk to him a bit about that. He said that, of course, it was symbolic. But he would have done it and the point was that we have a serious unaddressed issue of homelessness all throughout Ohio. From our cities to our rural Appalachian areas. 

Dennis has always been inspirational to me. He's a guy that stands up for what he believes even if it isn't the most politically savvy move. That's the kind of council person I want to be if you elect me as the next Ward 8 City Council leader on May 2, 2023 in the Democratic primary.
