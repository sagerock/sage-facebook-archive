            <div class="_2pin"><div>There is a theory in physics that says every electron in the known universe is actually the exact same single electron that has zipped across all of time and of space a near infinite number of times. <br/> <br/> There is a theory in religion that says there is only one human reliving near infinite lives that has zipped across all of time and of space a near infinite number of times. <br/> <br/> The value of this idea from a philosophical point of view is that your "enemy" is actually just you staring you in the face. That rich man you hate, that black man you hate, that conservative you hate, that liberal you hate... They are all you just coming from another point of view.</div><div></div></div>
