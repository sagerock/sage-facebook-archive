            <div class="_2pin"><div>Protestants are individualistic. And the Catholics are collective. <br/> <br/> At their best, Protestants paint a picture of a personal journey with God. At their worst they have no care about what they do to anyone else. They are still reacting to the idea that you can't buy your way into heaven. <br/> <br/> At their best, Catholics teach a community oneness with all the world. At their worst, they will cover up they most inhumane atrocities in the name of protecting the church. <br/> <br/> There is only one terrible answer to this. The answer that us passionate activists hate the most. <br/> <br/> The answer is that we must have balance of both.</div><div></div></div>
