I lose at every turn for wanting to do something so basic and fundamental as giving shelter to people that desperately need shelter. 

One of my great friends and profound advisors, Jamie Johns, has made it very clear that what I am doing is "unwinnable." 

Of course I'm going to lose over and over and over again. In fact, gaining even an inch of ground would be earth shattering. 

This is the truth of the system. "Assimilate or die." 

"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" was written by a bunch of revolutionary kids. The adults have long since taken over and we can't be so na√Øve to believe such childish ideas. 

But they are wrong. The revolutionaries are right. We must never stop fighting for the rights of being able to live the way you choose to live in your own country. In, of all places, the United States of Fucking America.

I. WILL. NOT. QUIT!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
