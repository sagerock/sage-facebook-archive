She is being induced. 

I've gotten the opportunity to work with several homeless women who were pregnant. (The Mother Mary story really resonates with me. If we can't shelter pregnant women in the most Christian country in the world then who CAN we shelter?)

I'm extremely proud of Aubrey. She has tried so hard to do the best thing for her unborn child. Ultimately, she is choosing adoption. She feels the parents are going to be able to provide a life she isn't able to right now. And they are going to be people who want a child SO badly. This baby will be loved.

I'm a big fan of Aubrey and Cole. They are really good kids. 

She is showing her wrist braces. Pregnancy has caused her to have carpal tunnel. If anyone has some new braces she could use them.

The adoption agency will be putting her up for about a week in a hotel. Then I believe she is planning on moving back to our tent village. If you are able support our community so we can continue to shelter people like Aubrey, you can do so here:
