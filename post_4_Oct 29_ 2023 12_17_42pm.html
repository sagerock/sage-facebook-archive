This is a church on Johnston in the east side of Akron. 

Whatever happened here was part of a bigger story. There is no easy way for a truck to end upside down in this yard. The angle of it all doesn’t make sense. 

I show you these shocking images because I know you will look at them. There is something about a human that just can’t look away from a train wreck. And then the algorithm of Facebook takes notice and then more people see it. 

I use your base desires to look at my posts so I can repeat my activist message:

The inner cities of America are a nightmare. And it’s exactly how the Republicans and Democrats want it. They want these people to die. This truck is a success story for our corporate leaders. 

Yes. Racism is real and still very much a systemic tool of extermination. But now Republicans and Democrats prefer the bigger genocidal umbrella of Classism. It works better for them to group all poor people together with class warfare. They both want these people to die any way possible. 

If you are a follower of either of the two ruling parties you are a blind, cult follower of murderers of poor, powerless people in the Middle East, in Africa, in Europe and right here in the good old U.S of A. 

I guess if that’s who you want to be loyal to that’s your thing. But at least don’t pretend you aren’t cheerleaders for genocidal murderers. 

Align with the people, not corporate slave traders and industrial military exterminators.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
