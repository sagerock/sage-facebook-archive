Mosley - I've been riding my bicycle around Ward 8 for my run for Ward 8 City Council.<br/> <br/> There are a lot of people out here that don't love the mayor options that are out here so far for the May 2023 Primary. A Ward 8 person mentioned that she'd like to see you run. She said she didn't know you personally but she liked you.</div><div></div></div>
