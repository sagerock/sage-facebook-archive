No one will talk to you for months at a time.
You are treated like dirt by workers. 
The amount of money they will give you isn't keeping up with today's rental costs. 
When your voucher expires you have to wait another 3 years to try again.

And that's just on the renter's side. As a landlord, I've been told to stay as far away from them as possible. 

I personally have had to go into a house to move a refrigerator and fix electric outlets that weren't grounded before a voucher was about to expire and a family became completely homeless. 

The entire housing ecosystem in Akron is rotten and broken. And all our current mayor cares about is parks. All of Akron is a surreal nightmare for low income people.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
