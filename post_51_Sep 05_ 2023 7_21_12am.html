This is a veteran whose house was condemned, couldn’t find an apartment even though he gets a check through veteran services. 

Today he officially will be living illegally in his own country. He will go to jail if he stays in his house. He will get a misdemeanor that could send him to jail for 30 days if he puts a tent on city land. 

I will go to jail if I let him put a tent on my property. 

He is excommunicated. He has been shunned from the very country he fought for. 

He is an American citizen. But he is now illegal. There is not one place he can sleep that won’t be against the law. 

I took this picture of him yesterday. He looked exhausted. He has both mental and physical health issues. It’s going to be extremely hot today. He’ll be outdoors. 

His name is Cadillac. 

This is wrong in every possible way.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
