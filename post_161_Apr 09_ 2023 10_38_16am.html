I heard him say he wish he had soup for breakfast every day. 

This came from the amazing food drive that you all participated in on Good Friday. There is so much amazing food here. Everyone is so elated and happy. ￼

Country is the guy who had all the toes removed on his left foot and 3 removed on his right due to infection and gang green. He is so much happier and he no longer smells like infection (I didn’t know that was a thing until I smelled it on Country.)

Happy Easter everyone!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
