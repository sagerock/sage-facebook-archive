That's a year and a half for "offenses" that are a direct cause of homelessness. 

I guarantee the "Trespass in a habitation", for which he got 1.5 years, was him just trying to sleep somewhere. 

"RSP" is receiving stolen property. That likely had to do with scrapping in abandoned buildings. 

Josh Randall is not some sort of home invader or a menace to society. He is just a guy who had no place to live. 

This is a waste in every imaginable way. YOU are paying to house Josh for the next year and a half. And all he ever wanted was a place he could put a tent.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
