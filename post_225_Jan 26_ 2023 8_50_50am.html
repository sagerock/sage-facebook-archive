Jennifer has what is known as "Lived Experience." She has got to be one of the most enlightened, thoughtful people on addiction and homelessness that I have ever met. 

Thank you for this lovely message, Jennifer. (this was on her Story).

I would love ANYONE to stop by tonight (Thursday, January 26, 2023) from 6-8pm at my COMMUNITYRAISER at @[100063454609669:2048:Mercedes' Tavern] to help me with my campaign for Akron City Council Ward 8. 

Money is not important. Coming together is what is important. They have a super cool pool table and jukebox. 

I hope you can make it.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
