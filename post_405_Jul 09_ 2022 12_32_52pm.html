            <div class="_2pin"><div>4 year old Journei Tolbert of Akron Ohio was shot in the head and killed yesterday. <br/> <br/> And now the mayor and Black pastors are calling for protestors to stop fighting for their rights out of respect for Journei. <br/> <br/> Martin Luther King Jr. had A LOT to say about Black clergy in his Letter from Birmingham Jail. In short, DON’T TRUST THEM. Now is never a good time for change, according to them. We are always asking for too much too fast, according to them. That’s just because they got theirs and they don’t care what happens to you. <br/> <br/> Journei needs MORE protests. MORE direct action. Journei was murdered for the same reason #JaylandWalker was murdered: leadership that ignores the brutal plight of average, everyday Akron citizens.</div><div></div></div>
