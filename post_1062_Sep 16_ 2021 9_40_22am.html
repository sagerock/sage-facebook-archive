Not Skidrow. Not NYC. Not San Francisco. AKRON MOTHER-FUCKING OHIO.

And the ONLY reason that is the case is because our @[139561179458303:274:City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office] Dan Horrigan has completely refused to address this problem. (He has a mad love affair with parks and roundabouts).

I want it to be known that I will always be grateful for Dan's bullheaded, hateful ignorance of the extreme poverty of his city. He is the 2-dimensional antagonist of a story between good and evil. His idiocy will lose him a third term in office and will permanently record him as the worst mayor in the history of Akron.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
