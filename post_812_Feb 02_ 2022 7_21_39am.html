He told me his daughter was trying to get on disability. <br/> <br/> Hi. It's nice to hear from you. I'm sorry you are going through this. Your daughter is lucky to have you. <br/> <br/> The wheels of the system move very slow, if at all. So, if you or a group of people are able to help, the situation needs triaged. You want to try to get her safe while keeping you and the rest of your family safe. <br/> <br/> Safety for her is going to include shelter and warmth. And there is a spectrum of these things. The best situation is a dry structure with electricity. A garage or shed is excellent. But a cheap tent from Walmart covered with a tarp and a bunch of blankets or a good sleeping bag will be fine. <br/> <br/> From there then you can work on getting her birth certificate, id and social security, the disability money, and then housing through the programs in your area. <br/> <br/> The balance is always keeping yourself emotionally and physically safe while helping keep her safe. If it becomes too much you absolutely have the right to back off and take a break. You can come back to help her if you feel up for it later. <br/> <br/> The longer she is homeless, the longer this process typically takes. There will likely be setback and frustrations. I'm sure you've already experienced many already. <br/> <br/> Thank you for reaching out and asking how to help your daughter. That's wonderful. <br/> <br/> Take care. <br/> Sage</div><div></div></div>
