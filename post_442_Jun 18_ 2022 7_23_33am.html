It is the foundation of our country. Akron wants to be a center for immigration. That’s great. But I’m telling you, a certain number of these people are going to become homeless. This man in this video said that he has lived here for four months. 

He was drunk. I don’t tell you that to make you dislike him, I tell that to you because addiction is not just a thing that low life losers from the hood of America do. Addiction is a brain disease.￼￼

This man has nowhere to live and he was carrying around his sleeping bag. He came to us because he was hungry. And he wanted some money. We gave him both.￼</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
