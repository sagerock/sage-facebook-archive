            <div class="_2pin"><div>Hey Dan - City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office  - a woman reached out to me that is living on the porch of the house she just got evicted from. I did what you told me to do. I said, "call 211.". So she did. Then they told her to call United Way. So she did. They told her that they would put her on a waiting list for shelter. So I don't know what else to do right now. Would you be willing to talk to her for me please and tell her what she can do in the meantime? <br/> Much love, <br/> Sage</div><div></div></div>
