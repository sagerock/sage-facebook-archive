I've been ruminating about the idea of finding a new piece of land somewhere else in Akron if you shut down my current camp. People are literally shitting themselves right here on Facebook at the thought of me coming to their neighborhood.  I just had to come back from the washroom to get all the terrified shit off of me. 

You can say whatever you want about me. But one thing is certain: I don't fuck around. I actually DO THINGS. 

The free market is a hell of a thing, huh Dan? I mean of course I'm not going to personally buy the property. I'll set up some shell company like all the other real estate buyers do. And then just like Santa coming down the chimney... Some unsuspecting neighborhood is going to get a truck load of the most homeless, homeless people I can find and put them right smack dab in the cutest little neighborhood I can find. 

(If anyone reading this is finding shit running down their legs out of mortal fear that I'll bring homeless people to their neighborhood, then CALL THE MAYOR AND TELL HIM TO LET ME DO MY WORK WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW.)</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
