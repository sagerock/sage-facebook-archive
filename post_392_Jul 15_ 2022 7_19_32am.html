            <div class="_2pin"><div>When I’m mayor of Akron I think I will likely keep the law department mostly intact. <br/> <br/> As I’ve sued them and they have sued me I’ve got to work with several people in the Akron law department. They care about upholding the law and they seem like genuinely good people. <br/> <br/> I think most of these people that work in the city are probably decent people. <br/> <br/> Nuisance inspector Jeff Ross, however, has got to go. He’s a conniving, lying asshole. I truly believe he hates poor people. He abuses his power to do whatever he wants. His focus is poor people and stealing their cars and belongings to “make good neighbors” as he has told me. <br/> <br/> I like the other inspectors who have worked with me on violations I’ve had. They are professional and respectful. But not Jeff. He’s truly a bad person.</div><div></div></div>
