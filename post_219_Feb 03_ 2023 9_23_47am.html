But I'll fill you in:

NEWS FLASH! Doctors are raping people all over Ohio and the oversight board is doing nothing about it.

This is a theme in America. No one is protected. 

Little kids are being gunned down in their schools.
Gymnasts are being raped by their doctors. 
Apparently everybody stands a chance of getting raped by their doctor.
It's 14 degrees and pregnant women are freezing on the streets of Akron.
People are doing from overdoses and nothing is being done to stop it.

I'M TELLING YOU! The establishment government gives ZERO FUCKS about any of us. I'm trying to swear less. But swearing is the least of our problems in this fucked up country. 

For the love of God please vote for me for Akron City Council on May 2, 2023. My opponent is just going to be more of this fuckery.

And PLEASE look at other local candidates. The status quo is failing us in the worst possible way.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
