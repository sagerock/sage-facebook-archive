(ah... That's never going to get old.)

For reelz... Someone has stolen our ice fishing tent. I've NEVER had a set up tent stolen before. But because it folds up so easily and it has no floor, that makes it ideal for stealing. 

I say: GOOD RIDDANCE. 

I slept in it on Christmas Eve. It actually might be worse than just sleeping directly in the rain. The seams aren't sealed. The windows are Velcro. Without a full tarp it's truly miserable to sleep in. 

Not having a floor makes even the slightest rain a deluge of mud and water. 

And then the size is just stupid. You can't fit even the smallest inflatable mattress in there well. 

Hopefully whoever took it is actually going to use it for ice fishing (or a brothel... Which is not going to be ideal, for all the reasons mentioned above.) Because I'm glad to get it out of my life.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
