"Relentless330 is about feeding and clothing the less fortunate and creating relationships and contacts that can assist in that â€¦. King Jesus is on the throne at Relentless330"

It amuses me that some of my liberal friends will likely cringe at the Christian message here.

BUT LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING:

I see WAY more Christians on the streets than I do atheists. (I certainly see communists and atheists, don't get me wrong. But they are less prevalent than my Christian friends.)

I don't care what your motivation is. I don't care how you do it. I don't care what you do. JUST DO IT.

For crying out loud: There are Americans starving and freezing on the streets of America. That's all the matters. Do something. DO ANYTHING.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
