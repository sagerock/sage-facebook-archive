            <div class="_2pin"><div>I LEARNED WHY AMHA VOUCHERS ARE EXPIRING IN AKRON OHIO<br/> <br/> I have a friend whose house burned down several months ago. She's a single mom with 6 kids. <br/> <br/> AMHA offered her a voucher for $1300/month rent. <br/> <br/> She found a 4 bedroom, 1.5 baths house off of Lover's Lane. The rental amount was $1500. <br/> <br/> AMHA WOULD ONLY GIVE HER $800 FOR THE HOUSE. <br/> <br/> What's worse, if my friend offers to pay the difference then AMHA will determine she didn't actually need their money and will take it all away. <br/> <br/> I was going to look into putting our charity's house in AMHA. But several people said not to do it. They said they'll come into your house and then potentially call the housing inspector if they don't like the house. <br/> <br/> I've been told houses have gotten condemned by allowing AMHA to come in. <br/> <br/> YET AGAIN, the system is rotten and out of touch.</div><div></div></div>
