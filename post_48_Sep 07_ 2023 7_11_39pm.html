            <div class="_2pin"><div>A couple days ago a woman pulled up to my building in a car. She was yelling that Sage Lewis cut off her water in the middle of her shower. <br/> <br/> She then began beating the living tar out of my truck. Every panel was hit with a tire iron. <br/> <br/> The problem was:<br/> A. I’ve never seen this woman in my life. <br/> B. I haven’t turned off water anywhere. <br/> C. The truck she beat up was not mine. It was a tenant at our building. She got the wrong truck. <br/> <br/> The police were called. They talked to her. There was nothing they could do. She just drove off. <br/> <br/> I don’t even know what to say about any of this.</div><div></div></div>
