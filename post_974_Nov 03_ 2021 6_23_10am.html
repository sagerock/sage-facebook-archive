            <div class="_2pin"><div>Look. It doesn't matter what you spiritually believe or don't believe. What happens after you die has nothing to do with what you think is going to happen to you. (a flat earther can believe the earth is as flat as a pancake all he wants. That doesn't make the earth any less round.)<br/> <br/> What I'm offering you is the truth that we, and every single thing in the universe, are all connected. And physicists are finding this truth in ever increasingly amazing ways. Quantum entanglement is something you really should get hip to if you haven't already. <br/> <br/> If you want to believe in Jesus, fine. Believe in the universal Christ that connects us all. But it's just one of nearly infinite ways to help you understand that we are all in this together. You are loved just as much as that rock sitting in your driveway is loved... Which is a lot (boundlessly) and by everything.</div><div></div></div>
