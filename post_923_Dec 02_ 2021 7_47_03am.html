            <div class="_2pin"><div>As you can see with the whole abortion debate at the Supreme Court, there is no law. There never has been. It's all power hungry politicians "interpreting" the law to get what they want. <br/> <br/> From the Bible to Confucius to Chinese Communism to American Democracy. It's all a lie. <br/> <br/> The powerful elite control us by making us think they are just "following the law."</div><div></div></div>
