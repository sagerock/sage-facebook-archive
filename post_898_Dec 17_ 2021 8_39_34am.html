            <div class="_2pin"><div>I would like to thank Judge Susan Baker Ross for accepting one of our residents at the Houseless Movement into her Drug Court program.<br/> <br/> Drug Court is a pretty amazing program. The way it works is: you go sit in a Judge's courtroom all day every day for a year. If you do that then all your charges get sealed. <br/> <br/> That's a HUGE deal for our person because that would mean she'd be able to get her kids back.<br/> <br/> This person not only fights addiction, but more importantly, fights significant mental health issues. <br/> <br/> We have made it mandatory for everyone who lives with us at the Houseless Movement House and Garden to go to a psychiatrist and do what they tell them to do. I believe mental illness drives everything... addiction, homelessness. Everything.<br/> <br/> This person REALLY appreciates this opportunity to be in the Drug Court program. And so do I. I'll do anything I can to help make it more successful. <br/> <br/> (this person lives in our garage.)</div><div></div></div>
