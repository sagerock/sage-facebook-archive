            <div class="_2pin"><div>Hey Gary Mikes, Destiny Lusk, Terri Lisle, and Richard Grass <br/> - Douglas Livingston is doing a story on jobs and is interested in hearing how you went from homeless to having really good jobs. <br/> <br/> Does anyone have Brooke's contact information. She works at Sam's Club. <br/> <br/> Please contact Doug to tell him your story. <br/> <br/> If you were homeless and got a job since Covid he'd probably like to hear your story too. <br/> <br/> If I can help with any of this please let me know.</div><div></div></div>
