            <div class="_2pin"><div>I want to thank Akron Police Department for helping me dispose of a potential quarter stick of dynamite. They also helped me with a gun a week ago that needed turned in. <br/> <br/> I am being given these things by some of my homeless friends for me to turn in. They are too scared to talk with the police. So I do it. <br/> <br/> In 5 years of doing this work I have never seen the level of weapons that are in our communities right now.</div><div></div></div>
