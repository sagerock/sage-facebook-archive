"I am part of the hotel voucher program from CSS. They had only so many openings and it seems the posting is making CSS look like they are discriminating. It's not their job to hunt down clients or potential clients to do what they need to do to help themselves. Someone very close to me once said "I'll fight with you not for you" I know e.b. and many others. If their "lifestyle" and recreational choices come first then they have no one to blame but themselves. We are all grown adults it's time that we all take responsibility for our own actions because the help is there you just have to reach out for it. Nothing in life is free nothing in life is just handed to you. No one is responsible for you but you. So stop blaming the programs when you don't even get off your ass to seek the help"

I've attached a video clip of E.B., the man she berates publicly. He very clearly has mental health issues. CSS is a mental health facility. E.B. has been kicked out of Haven of Rest for 60 days, the city threw away his tent and CSS blames him for making bad choices.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
