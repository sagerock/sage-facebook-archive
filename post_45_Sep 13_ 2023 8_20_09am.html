PAUL BUCHANAN. Aka O.P. (Old Paul). 

He lived in a tent with us for a couple years after the house he was living in burned down. 

Paul has lived all over the world, including war torn countries. 

In our book, “Out of the Shadows - An American Homeless Story” he says:

“ This tent, community is a refugee situation. We are not running from the bomb or bullet, but we tend to hide from, or look for safety from, the misunderstanding of the larger society. These people here have a lot of behavior issues and idiosyncrasies from past lifestyle, circumstances, and patterns. I think people here want to rebuild and reestablish themselves, but so much has taken place that sometimes they can’t manage to reset and redirect, so they look for organizations like this one to help.”</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
