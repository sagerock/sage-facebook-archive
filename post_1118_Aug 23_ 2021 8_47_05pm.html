            <div class="_2pin"><div>Most people are not Christian. They think "believing in Jesus" means all you have to do is bend the knee and swear allegiance. That's what a God of Earth demands. Committing to the god of all creation means that you must believe in forgiveness over vengeance, love over fear, hope over pessimism. THAT'S what it means to believe in Jesus Christ. <br/> <br/> â€œFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. '<br/> <br/> There's too much fear and anger for there to be much Christianity at all.</div><div></div></div>
