She is talking with me on August 19, 2017 about what she loved most about our homeless-run tent city and day center.

It has all since been destroyed and shut down by the city of Akron. And I am now being sued by the city that if I ever put so much as one tent on my property I face fines and jail time. 

Imagine building a community and then having it stolen from you.

This is nothing new. Native Americans, Black Americans, and Japanese Americans (in World War II), to name a few. There is a long list of Americans who have had their community and belongings and very existence stolen from them by the American Government. 

I chose to show you this on Thanksgiving because it is quite possible you are having a wonderful Thanksgiving while many others of the past, present and future are not thankful because of what has been stolen from them. 

You should be thankful. Lord knows I am. But we must also remember those who have less to be thankful for and try in our own way, no matter how big or small, to make the community we live in a place where ALL people can find a place to live in peace. 

Be thankful. But practice finding acceptance for others that are not like you. ALL PEOPLE. 

I hope you eat so much delicious food today. I hope you are inside and warm. I hope you are around people you love and love you.

I LOVE YOU.

Happy Thanksgiving.
