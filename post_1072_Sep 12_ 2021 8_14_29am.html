            <div class="_2pin"><div>"My body. My choice."<br/> <br/> Do you actually believe that? Or was that just some catch phrase you used to selfishly get what you want? Cuz if that's all it is then that makes you as big a hypocritical asshole as the conservatives you like to condemn and chastise for doing the exact same thing as you. <br/> <br/> NATIONAL VACCINATION LAWS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND A DYSTOPIAN NIGHTMARE.
