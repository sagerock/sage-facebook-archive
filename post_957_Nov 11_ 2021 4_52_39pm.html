            <div class="_2pin"><div>FOOD NEEDED. <br/> There is a person living unsheltered near the Lebron Tangiers (I'm not sure what we're calling it). Some of the workers have befriended this woman. They say she is in need of food. <br/> I guess if food is put in the stairwell of the parking deck she will know to look for it there. <br/> <br/> Thank you if you are able to help.</div><div></div></div>
