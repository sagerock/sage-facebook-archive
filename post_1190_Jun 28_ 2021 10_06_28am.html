It reminded me that I wanted to chat with @[139561179458303:274:City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office], Dan Horrigan.

Here is our offer: Commit to giving us a sanctioned tent village and tiny house village for our homeless Akron citizens by July 4, 2021, or we the people of Akron will begin our own Independence from you. The Uprising will officially begin and you will hear the voice of the people.

WE WILL EVICT YOU FROM YOUR MAYORAL THRONE just as you have evicted Akron citizens at a higher rate than any other city in Ohio. WE WILL SWEEP YOU FROM OFFICE just as you sweep the homes of your poorest citizens.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
