            <div class="_2pin"><div>To be compassionate literally means to "suffer with."<br/> <br/> I have heard some kind and very humbling things about the work I do with our homeless neighbors. I believe that this is because we are fundamentally wired for compassion. We see compassion in action and we raise it up and celebrate it. <br/> <br/> I encourage you to suffer with your family, friends and neighbors. Don't fix. Just sit with them and hold some of their suffering with them. <br/> <br/> You will find that you both will feel better. That's because this is the work we are all meant to be doing. Practicing compassion is the big work of our lives.</div><div></div></div>
