It's pretty ironic considering I JUST wrote about how Summa Healthâ€™s St. Thomas Hospital is where AA started.

St. Thomas Hospital opened in 1928. Eleven years later, the late Sister Ignatia and the late Dr. Robert H. Smith, known as Dr. Bob and the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, together created the first hospital-based unit in the country devoted to the treatment of alcoholism. In its first decade, the detox ward at St. Thomas Hospital treated more than 5,000 individuals.

And now they are throwing homeless people off their land that have NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

Jim has a dog. He can't go to any shelter with his dog. Even if he decided to get an apartment today, there is NO WAY he would be able to move in by the 22nd. 

SO WHERE DOES A GUY LIKE JIM GO?

Akron is currently suing me to try to make it so if I give a tent to someone and that tent goes on residential land ANYWHERE IN AKRON, me and ALL the people involved in that transaction would be in contempt of court. 

They are systematically trying to make it illegal to help homeless people. (I wouldn't be at all surprised if it was Akron city that was pressuring Summa to kick Jim off their land.)

THIS IS WRONG ON EVERY POSSIBLE LEVEL. 

@[739631612:2048:Shammas Malik] - if you become mayor would you PLEASE at least consider talking about some new ideas to help homeless Akronites? Because what we are doing right now is cruel and unusual punishment. 

The Supreme Court has held that it is cruel and unusual punishment to criminalize homelessness based on long-standing legal principles that people cannot be punished for their status. Likewise, people without shelter retain fundamental constitutional protections.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
