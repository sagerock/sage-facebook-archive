I truly wish I could be more like you. <br/> <br/> You don't deserve all the suffering you've been forced to endure. (For what it's worth, I believe we are meant to suffer so we can grow and become stronger for some reason that is unclear to me.)<br/> <br/> I love you. <br/> <br/> Please take care of yourself.</div><div></div></div>
