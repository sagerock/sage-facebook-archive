She may mean that she is getting the voucher for the hotels. 

I am going to let this post stand for now as it is still a conversation about the lack of care and understanding they feel when working with these people.

The fact remains that E.B. went to CSS 3 times with @[101653155288483:274:Serve The People Akron] and was denied a voucher.

ORIGINAL POST:

A person from @[103601489691547:274:Community Support Services] posted over at the @[1322881064439391:69:Houseless Movement Group]. Apparently, the position of CSS is that homeless people are lazy, no good losers that need to get their act together. And Service Providers are God's gift to humanity.

This comment from the person who works on the hotel voucher program at CSS is SO eye-opening.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
