I took this picture last year when she was pregnant. She stayed in our house during that time. 

She is pregnant again and is due in May. I’ve been trying to get her to move into our house again all winter long. But her anxiety has been too much. I couldn’t get her to leave her tent. 

Yesterday I went to her camp to drop off a tank of propane that you donated for her. It’s going to be in the 50s again next week. Her friend Kristen, who lives in our house, was hanging out with her when I got there. 

Kristen has also been trying to get her to move back into the house. 

Together, Kristen and I convinced her to come take a shower and give it a try. 

We did it! She came to the house. 

Hopefully she will stay at least until she gives birth. 

All I want is to try to make these people safe. I don’t want anything else. I often fail. But sometimes, sometimes I succeed. I really hope this is one of those times I succeed.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
