He is looking for meth on the road because he has no money. He did this for about 14 hours yesterday. People were afraid he was going to get run over. 

 I asked him if he wanted to come live with us. He said he'd love to but he has no money. I said it doesn't cost anything to live with us. 

It's highly unlikely I'll be able to get M in a tent. He just scours the road for meth.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
