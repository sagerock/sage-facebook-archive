            <div class="_2pin"><div>Hey Josh Imler, check this story out.<br/> <br/> I have a friend in Texas, Jane Piper-Lunt who is a big supporter and advocate for homeless people in her community.<br/> <br/> She read your story about deciding to be sober (which you've done for a year now) and moving out of the houseless life. It moved her and she read it to a homeless friend of hers, Steve. <br/> <br/> Apparently Steve also has a daughter he misses. <br/> <br/> He read your story and it INSPIRED HIM to get sober and leave houselessness. <br/> <br/> YOU DID THAT, MAN! <br/> <br/> He's got a good job, he's getting back with his family. He visits his daughter at her tumbling classes and talks to her on the phone.  It's the whole deal. <br/> <br/> You inspired a guy you never have met and probably never will meet to change his life. <br/> <br/> That's mind blowing. <br/> <br/> YOU ROCK!</div><div></div></div>
