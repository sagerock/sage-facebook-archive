            <div class="_2pin"><div>I believe houseless people are on to something. There is a reason some people are on the street for years. There is a reason the movie Nomadland's van life was so compelling. There is a reason campgrounds are completely booked up a year in advance. <br/> <br/> Houses cost a million dollars. Young people and old people can't afford "the American Dream."<br/> <br/> There was a time. A very long time. When we were nomads. I think some of us are waking up to that memory.</div><div></div></div>
