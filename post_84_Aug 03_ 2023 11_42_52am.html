            <div class="_2pin"><div>THANKS TO YOU...<br/> <br/> We have currently paid $800 on our water bill for our homeless house. We only have $378.28 left on that bill. (I'll probably be able to pay that rest off soon. I just am waiting for a little more more money to electronically transfer.)<br/> <br/> I'm going to call and see if they'll bring our trash cans back.<br/> <br/> We paid off our electric bill that was: $277.95<br/> And we paid off our gas bill that was: $452.79<br/> <br/> Yesterday I got a text from a friend I hadn't heard from in a long time. He was my mom's next door neighbor. He always kept an eye out for her.<br/> <br/> He texted me and wanted to donate $200 to help with these utility bills. I was so overwhelmed by the emotion of that act that I could barely look at my screen to reply back. <br/> <br/> The giving and kindness you show over and over and over again is such a bright light of love that I sometimes can barely look at it. I'm so overwhelmed and inspired and awe-struck by you.<br/> <br/> But I'm never surprised. I can barely handle the love of it all. But it comes every time. Your generosity and kindness is like clockwork. <br/> <br/> And what really blows me away is that this isn't for helping some adorable puppies. I'm asking you to help some real complicated adult humans. But you do it every time.<br/> <br/> The Bible says that God created humans in his own image. That's probably true. We are oftentimes a real mess. But at the heart of it all, we want to do good. We want to be a positive force in the world. All of us want that. I wouldn't be surprised that if there was or is some grand creator of this all that they are pretty much a lot like us. A mess that meant well. <br/> <br/> You are so kind. So wonderful. So beautiful. <br/> <br/> Thank you from the bottom of my heart. <br/> <br/> I am nothing without you.<br/> Sage</div><div></div></div>
