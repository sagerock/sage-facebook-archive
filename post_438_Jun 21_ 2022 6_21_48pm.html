            <div class="_2pin"><div>I killed Andrew. <br/> <br/> That was the news I received when I came to the camp today. <br/> <br/> I killed him because we had a joint checking account together and I wasn’t giving him any of the money in the account. I also was stealing his social security money. I think I killed him because he had too much dirt on me, is what I’ve been told. <br/> <br/> I was just talking about this with a person who believes he is a demigod. <br/> <br/> And this gets deeper to the root of our problems here at our homeless camp. <br/> <br/> Mental illness, drug-induced psychosis mixed with wild stories leads to a life of mental torture. <br/> <br/> Andrew believed the things about the checking account and social security. I had to get a secure mailbox because he continually was stealing my mail. <br/> <br/> And then that story evolved into me murdering him. <br/> <br/> The life of homeless people is extreme mental and physical chaos. They don’t believe in the mental health field. So they self medicate and it exacerbates the situation. <br/> <br/> This entire thing is a mess and no one is experimenting and testing new ideas. <br/> <br/> Here are a few ideas right off the rip for Akron:<br/> 1. Defund our parks which we spent $25 million on last year and give it to mental health professionals. We need them on the streets with mobile doctors offices. We need more facilities for people to go to. We need to empower mental health professionals to be able to help these people. <br/> <br/> 2. We need 1000 $300/month all utilities included apartments for people on ssi. <br/> <br/> 3. The DSM clearly states that drug addiction is a mental illness. We need to treat it like that and not a crime. <br/> <br/> I have to run. But you get the idea.</div><div></div></div>
