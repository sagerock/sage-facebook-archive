            <div class="_2pin"><div>Oppression is a funny thing. <br/> <br/> The oppressors (usually wealthy whites, but certainly not always) never see it that way. They brainwash themselves into thinking it's the victim's fault.<br/> <br/> Native Americans are lazy addicts.<br/> Black Americans are lazy addicts.<br/> Appalachian Americans are lazy addicts.<br/> LatinX Americans are lazy addicts. <br/> Homeless Americans are lazy addicts.<br/> And of course Addicted Americans are lazy addicts.<br/> <br/> Does anyone see a pattern here? <br/> <br/> Fox News and the New York Post can take anyone they don't like and just add "lazy addicts" to their entire people and the problem is solved. <br/> <br/> Meanwhile, the truth is that addiction is a biproduct of decades and generations of having the powerful's boot squarely on their necks and then being yelled at to get up and get to work. "Why are you so lazy laying down there?" GET UP!</div><div></div></div>
