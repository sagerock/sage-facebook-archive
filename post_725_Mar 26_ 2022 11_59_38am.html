            <div class="_2pin"><div>I usually manage my emotions by getting angry at a cold, calculating and cruel system that truly has disdain and hatred for people who are suffering and hurt.<br/> <br/> But today (maybe it's the weather) I just have sadness. There are 3 situations that have made me sad. They really isn't much of a point in sharing these stories. There isn't anything you or I can do about them. <br/> <br/> All I'll do is just spread sadness further into the world. <br/> <br/> But I decided to share at least one for one reason: I need you to know that your kindness and generosity and compassion make a difference. When everyone else has written off a person, you are there to let them know that someone DOES care. YOU CARE. It seems like not much. But when you are all alone in the world and a stranger comes by to offer a small amount of kindness, it makes a WORLD of difference.<br/> <br/> Here is an email I just received this morning...<br/> <br/> Hi there. My sister sent me some posts recently where there’s a go fund me for her and you drove her to another state?<br/> <br/> She has a whole family who was willing to let her stay with them and help her. Her dad is not drug addicted and offered her a home. She left willingly to stay with her loser drug dealing boyfriend. She stayed with my sister for a period of time but then my sister asked her to help with the dishes or do chores and she only asked for money for Taco Bell or cigarettes while pregnant. My sister said if you’re goina stay please get a job or help around the house and instead again chose on her own to leave to stay with her boyfriend who cannot keep a job. She is quite the manipulator. She only texts us or shows up when she wants something. True her mom is a complete deadbeat but my brother stepped up to the plate and gained full custody of her. He wasn’t perfect but in no way abusive or a deadbeat. She has grandparents who would bend over backwards for her until she would lie and steal from them.<br/> <br/> I’m just letting you know this not to make you feel bad but to maybe vet out who you spend your resources on. She refuses to work. At a certain point you need to help yourself. She’s old enough to make her own awful decisions. And continues to do so.<br/> <br/>  I’m sad that she’s bringing a child into her ridiculous situation with a deadbeat dad and she refuses to stop smoking or using pot while pregnant. A family can only help so much. She has to help herself and she refuses. She chose to stay in a tent with her deadbeat boyfriend. These are all her choices.  Now she’s very far away from Ohio where her family is.<br/> <br/> Good luck to you and your mission. It’s needed but there are people out there who honestly are choosing their own choices and no matter how much you give them it will not change their situation.</div><div></div></div>
