            <div class="_2pin"><div>Since the beginning of creating homeless tent villages I've been very open to working with the police. We often want the same things: Less violence on the streets. We aren't a place to hide anyone from the law... especially people that burn down buildings and try to outright kill people. <br/> <br/> There are a few REALLY dangerous people out there. And it's not the drug dealers typically. It's usually seriously mentally ill people. <br/> <br/> But anyway... there is a newer Akron Police Department officer that is making AMAZING connections with me and several of our homeless neighbors. He's a great communicator, highly ethical and a really hard worker. <br/> <br/> He came up on the Eastside of Akron. He was a lower income kid that took a different path. <br/> <br/> He knows how to use relationships in powerful ways. He's always looking for the win-win. He'll help keep us safe if we help him track down violent people. It's extremely cool. <br/> <br/> I'm trying to get him to let me talk about him specifically. But he hasn't wanted to let me do that yet.</div><div></div></div>
