            <div class="_2pin"><div>Be aware that the white liberal elites (who are actually just incrementalist moderates) are trying to make poor people, black people and homeless people more like them. No one with the slightest awareness of their country should have any desire to be more like these people. They are terrified of change and willing to sacrifice anyone or anything to maintain their way of life. <br/> <br/> Just look at what they think is the "bad" side of town. It's black and poor. Everything they hate.</div><div></div></div>
