        <div class="post-content">
            <div class="_2pin"><div>By my estimation, 70% of adults are selfish pricks. They only care about themselves and possibly their nuclear family (but even that is often a stretch). But, also by my estimation, 70% of people under 18 are caring, giving, wonderful people. <br/> <br/> I believe this transformation happens because most people catch a disease called Fear. But they don’t see it as a negative thing. They see it as being realistic. You’ll hear them say things like, “I’m just being realistic.”<br/> <br/> No one has enough data and computing power to predict the outcome of the value of being kind and caring versus being cruel and hateful. So we all are left to live any life we want and feel justified with our selfish, inhumane choices. <br/> <br/> But really, most people are just terrified because their parents were cruel to them and then the entire world is seen through a door of perception that is colored with fear and hate. You really can’t blame them. They aren’t bad people. They are just broken. <br/> <br/> And so the entire hope of humanity rests on the shoulders of the 30% who didn’t catch the fear disease. <br/> <br/> These “Realists” don’t have some corner on truth and reality. They just have rationalized their hatefulness. <br/> <br/> Love and understand the most hated people you can find. Nazis. Pedophiles. Drug addicts. Young inner city Black boys and men. Women who get abortions. Racists. Murderers. Thieves. Christians. Muslims. Immigrants. (I could make this list forever. There are so many hated people. Pick your favorite hated person and go with it.)<br/> <br/> This is critically necessary if humanity is ever to progress out of its hell hole of seemingly eternal self destruction.  <br/> <br/> The Fearless 30% are the way, the light and the life. The Fearless 30% are the messengers of the  Creator. You are the only people that understand what I am saying about complete and total radical love. The 70% are so damaged and hurt so much, these words sound like madness to them. And they need our love most of all. <br/> <br/> Fear is a contagion that spreads through words. Fear is the most contagious and deadly disease humanity has ever experienced. <br/> <br/> There is only one antidote to the disease of Fear: Total, unconditional love, understanding and forgiveness. <br/> <br/> Don’t let their fear consume you. Just let go and forgive and understand and love. Everyone.</div><div></div></div>
