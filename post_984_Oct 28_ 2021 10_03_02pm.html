            <div class="_2pin"><div>Isn't it "funny" how the idea of God, whose very definition is All of All, becomes a divider among humans? It's such a prevelant reality that it makes me think there must be something to it. <br/> <br/> God connects and divides. Or maybe God connects and man divides. Maybe that's why we are here on Earth. To practice the truth of connection. Or maybe we are just a reflection of God. Both wonderful and terrible. Maybe we are just here to amuse God like fish in an aquarium.</div><div></div></div>
