My son just finished his junior year at Firestone Highschool. <br/> <br/> Ethan Liming was in Akron with his friends having fun. My son goes out with his friends and hangs out in Akron having fun. <br/> <br/> Ethan Liming was beaten to death on a basketball court in Akron last night. My son is sitting here with me right now. <br/> <br/> I am so easily able to imagine my son being Ethan Liming. They had classes together. <br/> <br/> I don't know what to even say about this.</div><div></div></div>
