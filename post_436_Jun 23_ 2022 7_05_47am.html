            <div class="_2pin"><div>Drug dealers from Detroit came to Akron this week. <br/> <br/> They put a gun to the face of a woman who owed them. They absolutely would have killed her if a friend of hers hadn't intervened and said he'd get the money. <br/> <br/> The amount she owed was $500. <br/> <br/> There is a rumor that a woman in Akron shot a man in the face. I can't confirm yet if this is true or not. But if it is, it's because he sold her fake drugs. <br/> <br/> The amount she paid was $100. <br/> <br/> ******<br/> This is why I'd never be a drug dealer. It's not like what you see on Breaking Bad. I mean I'm sure that kind of level of work goes on. But that's not what is happening on the street. <br/> <br/> People are killing people over nothing. <br/> <br/> I wouldn't drive to Cleveland for $500. <br/> <br/> I'm telling you these stories to give you a sense of the chaos and torment and brutality of the streets of Akron. Akron is no joke. It's filled with torture and death. <br/> <br/> These people are getting pressed from every angle. The cops treat them like dirt. The drug dealers put them in debt so they can control them forever. <br/> <br/> There is no safety anywhere. <br/> <br/> I told a woman yesterday that I loved her. She said no one has ever told her that before. <br/> <br/> How can we expect these people to rise up when everyone around them is telling them they are garbage? <br/> <br/> We have huge swaths of our community that feels they are worthless. This worthlessness began when the factories left and the prisons sprung up. <br/> <br/> We are in a deep hole here.</div><div></div></div>
