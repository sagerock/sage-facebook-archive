            <div class="_2pin"><div>I have a friend who is a pedophile. He did his time. But he carries that stigma with him always. <br/> <br/> He came and sat with me at my camp tonight. He had a burger. He said he wasn’t hungry. But he had a burger anyway. He did it because he knew it would make me happy. <br/> <br/> He ALWAYS goes out of his way to help anyone that asks. <br/> <br/> No one else came back because they were terrified the police would come and pretty much all my friends have open warrants. <br/> <br/> This guy has a warrant too. But he came anyway. <br/> <br/> I certainly don’t blame anyone for not sticking around for our Homeless sleepout event. It’s not worth going to jail over. <br/> <br/> Another friend, a former skin head, just got out of prison after doing a 10 month bit. He said he has 20 felonies and has done 19 years. I love this guy. He is so well read and so smart. He and I have the best conversations. <br/> <br/> I really truly believe we have to take people for who they are right now, right before your eyes. I don’t really care who you were yesterday. <br/> <br/> Homelessness has connected me to the most diverse and interesting people I have ever met. If you are homeless I’m going to try to help you no matter what. If you want to help homeless people I’m going to try to work with you no matter what. All that other stuff is irrelevant when we are all working on a common cause. <br/> <br/> It’s pretty quiet out here right now. I’ve camped in much worse weather conditions. I think there is a raccoon checking out my trash that is freaking me out at the moment. And the Goodyear clock bell is SOOOO loud. But otherwise things are good. <br/> <br/> I’ll talk to you in the morning.</div><div></div></div>
