He just moved in this week. 

He is the clear winner of Best Houseless Living Space. 

The fire pit I guess will be only for decoration because the fire department said they'd bring the police the next time anyone had a fire. Nevermind that it's been below freezing all week. People that live houseless are disgusting pigs that deserve to freeze to death. 

And Black homeless people. Forget about it. Could there be any greater scourge on America the Beautiful than a Black homeless person? 

We all know that America is the greatest country to ever exist in the history of humanity and even daring to talk about the inhumanity of racism, addiction-hate and homelessness being anything other than self-inflicted personal failure needs to be outlawed. 

I'm so impressed by your work Tusk. This setup has given me so many ideas. Thank you for being with us.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
