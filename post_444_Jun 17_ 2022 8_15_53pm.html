            <div class="_2pin"><div>In my head this camp is already closed. <br/> <br/> I'm thinking about where I go next. <br/> <br/> My feeling is that I will probably not open another camp until I can afford a full-time security person. They are currently $50/hour. <br/> <br/> And I will likely never to be able to afford that if I'm running a camp that the city declares is illegal. There isn't a single organization of significant size in Akron that will publicly support me against the mayor's will. <br/> <br/> So I think I will focus on setting up micro-camps throughout city. I'll get a trailer (a Nomadic Spirit trailer) and bring supplies to them. Tents. Tarps. Propane. Etc. Other organizations already bring food. <br/> <br/> I won't have to worry about hauling trash, which is the majority of my job. That will significantly free me up to work with these other camps. They can burn trash at their camp. Or not. I can provide burn barrels which will help with heat. <br/> <br/> Homelessness has not ended in Akron with the closing of my camp. I'm not really sure the mayor truly understands that.</div><div></div></div>
