The biggest surprise working with homeless people is all the junk they stuff in all drains. 

This stuff was so jammed in this drain that Sully and I had to sledgehammer the floor and cut this drain pipe out of the dirt. That brush-thing was so jammed in the pipe that I needed vice grips to pull it out. 

The good news is, the nail polish found in the drain was still good and a homeless woman took it and immediately painted her nails with it.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
