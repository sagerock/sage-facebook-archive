for standing up for Imokhai Okolo to be on Akron Citizens' Police Oversight Board.

Margo Sommerville is quoted as saying:
“Imokhai checks a couple of boxes,” said Sommerville. “One, he’s an attorney. [He's an] African American male between the ages of 18 and 35. He has ties to Freedom BLOC, advocating for social justice. He represents, oftentimes, lower income and disadvantaged [residents] because he does a lot of pro bono work for evictions.”

Anyone refusing to accept Okolo on the list, Sommerville said, has nothing to do with "confusion" over the selection process and everything to do with "not wanting him."

She is referring to Jeff Fusco who is quoted as saying:
“I’m also concerned about some of the names. I’m hoping we can take time and do the research,” Fusco said, alluding to residency and voting records but not publicly naming Okolo.

I often debate if some people are truly evil. Like, does evil even exist? Then I look at Jeff Fusco and I say, "Yup. Evil is real."</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
