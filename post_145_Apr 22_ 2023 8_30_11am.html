He stays at our house sometimes. He’s a proud member of the Crips. He taught me that Crips stand for: Community Revolution In Progress. 

I asked him what he’d like society to help him with. He told me he’d like to run a free breakfast for kids. 

He told me he has done a lot of bad things in society. He’d like to start doing some good. 

I am very interested in the gang communities in Akron. I think that might be where I want to expand my work next. 

Ray Greene Jr…. I know this is an area that interests you too. @[560734541:2048:Tara L. Mosley] suggested I reach out to you and @[100064846508272:2048:The Freedom BLOC] to see if this is something we could maybe work on. 

People. ALL PEOPLE are filled with all the goodness and all the badness of the universe. Death and Life are fighting a great war all across the universe. A very important battlefield is a place we call Earth. We must be on the side of Life. Life must win. And we must always be recruiting members to the Life side.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
