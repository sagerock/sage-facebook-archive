He brought these AMAZING electric blankets and socks. I love electric blankets because they use less energy than electric heaters. And people say that oftentimes they don't even need a heater when they use these blankets. 

 I want to mention that Phil very reluctantly let me take this picture. Most people are that way. They are adamant that they are not doing this for accolades or gratitude. But I always try to get people to take a picture so that others can see the goodness in humanity. It's truly overwhelming.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
