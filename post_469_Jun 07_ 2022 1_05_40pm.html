            <div class="_2pin"><div>Dear City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office - <br/> <br/> I guess if you want to talk about homelessness through continually suing me that's cool. As long as we keep talking, that's what's important. <br/> <br/> My point is not to hide people in my backyard in tents. I am as much an activist as I am a servant. Maybe someday you will finally understand that there are people with nowhere else to go other than the woods. (A woman who had a stroke came to me last week with everything she owned which was just the hospital gown they sent her out the door in. The women's shelters all have waiting lists. And sometimes they aren't the right fit for a person. So I sheltered her in my backyard and fellow homeless people gave her a tent and clothes and food.)<br/> <br/> But I am quite sure you aren't hearing me on that. You likely just think these people are lazy drug addicts that come to me so they can do more drugs. (Drugs are done ALL THE TIME in the Haven and the Battered Women's Shelter. People die of overdoses in them too.)<br/> <br/> MY ACTUAL POINT OF THIS POST IS THIS: Could you please update your lawsuit against me to the rightful owner of the property? Your information was outdated. The Houseless Movement gave all that land to the Church of the Nomadic Spirit. They owned it before you filed your lawsuit. So, could you please send me an updated filing of your lawsuit with our church as the group you are suing? I think that will be more fun. <br/> <br/> Have a great day. I'm not afraid of you. And you are wrong on every possible level.<br/> <br/> Love,<br/> Sage</div><div></div></div>
