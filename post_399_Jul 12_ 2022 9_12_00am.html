But they didn't tell anyone and met online instead of in person.

MANY people (myself included) came to City Hall not knowing about this bomb threat. We could have easily been victims of a bombing that City Council knew about but didn't let the people know who showed up at City Hall.

THESE PEOPLE ARE HIDEOUS MONSTERS. They don't care about anyone other than themselves. 

SHUT IT DOWN!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
