(If you think this money is cool, wait till I gather all the blankets and tents and sleeping bags and food and hats and gloves that people brought and take a picture of those. My truck absolutely cannot hold one more glove because it is so full with the things you brought. And the Reverend and my friend @[100069055875537:2048:Gary Mikes]  cars are packed too. (they stayed the night with me, which is its own kind of beautiful generosity. Reverend @[100044166396614:2048:John Beaty] is 83 years old and stayed the night.))

GOD HAD TO BE BIRTHED IN A BARN IN A ANIMAL FOOD TROUGH because there was "no room at the inn."

2021 years later there is still no room at the inn for homeless pregnant moms, homeless veterans, homeless senior citizens, homeless kids and SO many more.

BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW THIS...

The more horrendous tragedy I see the more absolutely humbling kindness and generosity I see. 

While I continue to fight for the right to shelter homeless people on my own land I have one single solitary message I must get out. YOU MUST KNOW that humanity is overwhelmingly kind and good and generous. Evil is powerful. But it is small and few. Goodness is massive and many. 

I love you. I love you. I love you.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
