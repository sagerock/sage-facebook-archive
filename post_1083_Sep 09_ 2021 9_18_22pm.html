But I also know you read every word I write. <br/> You should know that your homeless citizens are now officially starting to get diagnosed with Covid. So if you were at all able to think more than one step ahead, maybe you could slow your roll on all the camp sweeps you've got coming up. Almost none of them are vaccinated and so you're just going to spread that shit all over town. <br/> And Summit County Continuum of Care I know you like to stay out of politics which means you'd rather let the people you are in charge of die on the streets that say anything contradictory to the mayor. But remember when you set that Covid station up and no one came? Now might be a good time to actually implement a homeless Covid plan. <br/> (Neither of these people will do one damn thing. But at least I can say I tried.)</div><div></div></div>
