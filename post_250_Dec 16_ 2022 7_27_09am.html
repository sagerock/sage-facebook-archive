            <div class="_2pin"><div>This is incredible news:<br/> <br/> Akron's Emergency Overnight Shelter could be opening next week...<br/> <br/> The weather forecast for later next week looks ominous and there is a high probability that we will be launching this season's version of The Emergency Overnight Shelter. There are many other places that Terry and I would rather be on Christmas Eve and Christmas Night but, if the weather forecast is correct, we'll be offering the absolute best Christmas Gift possible to folks in need... a safe, warm place to spend the night instead of outside in the freezing elements. <br/> <br/> Please start checking your calendars. The official call will be made on Monday, December 19th. An email will be sent out with instructions how to help out on the Sign-Up Genius.<br/> <br/> Thank you all for your consideration and support. Until Monday, please enjoy a wonderful, safe weekend.<br/> <br/> David Churbock</div><div></div></div>
