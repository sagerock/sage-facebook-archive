            <div class="_2pin"><div>The fun thing about the Bible is that observant people know that you can get that thing to support or condemn anything you want it to. For me, that symbolically represents that it's ALL God and all paths lead to God. <br/> As you might imagine, I have been enjoying the anti establishment messages of the Bible. Paul was the church guy. But not a church of the government which is what we mostly have now. A church of the people under one law. The law of love, compassion and empathy. Uniting the people, railing against oppressive regimes of the government.</div><div></div></div>
