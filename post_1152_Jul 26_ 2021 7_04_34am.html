I make it very clear that I don't want the government to pay a dime to care for homeless people. I just want the government to get out of the way so people like me can do it. 

So this morning this friend sent me this screenshot of the charges of a homeless friend who is currently in jail... Richard Grass. 

Well... Now it's YOU who are paying to shelter and feed Richard Grass... At about $40,000/year. 

When Richard lived at our tent village he was on the security team and he was constantly helping other villagers. He had purpose in his life. And he wasn't trespassing for trying to sleep somewhere. 

On the street he has no purpose and no hope. 

The fact that I have to fight SO hard to shelter homeless people at ZERO cost to the city and anyone who doesn't want to support my work is utter madness.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
