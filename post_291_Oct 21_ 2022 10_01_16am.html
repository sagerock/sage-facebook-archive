            <div class="_2pin"><div>A homeless person messaged me recently (I hadn't talked to her in MONTHS.)<br/> She said she needs her mail and a phone she had sent to my office immediately or she was going to "Report" me.<br/> <br/> These encounters are where the learning in life is most important for my personal journey.<br/> <br/> "No good deed goes unpunished" is a very real experience. It's almost as if the universe wants to test you to see if you truly were doing a good deed or if you were just trying to make yourself feel good about yourself for doing something nice.<br/> <br/> I have seen MANY people leave the helping world after being betrayed by someone they were trying to help. I've seen people hit, stolen from, deceived and yelled at by the very people they were bending over backwards to help. <br/> <br/> I TRULY BELIEVE THAT'S THE UNIVERSE ASKING YOU IF YOU ARE READY FOR THE LESSONS THAT COME NEXT.<br/> <br/> If you drop out, that's fine. You learned what you were ready to learn. But if you are willing to stay, you are going to enter a world of learning that very few people experience.<br/> <br/> That image of Jesus hung up on that cross is probably the all time best imagery of this lesson. How do you love the very people that will kill you or kill your family because you got involved in helping them? It's huge.</div><div></div></div>
