            <div class="_2pin"><div>You need to know that we all are children of the entire universe. And we are children from a place beyond space and time. (This is not voodoo I’m referring to. This is current accepted science.)<br/> <br/> Because of this, we are everything. We hold everything within us. <br/> <br/> We are Jesus and we are Hitler. (And we are descendants of much worse and much greater people from the “future.”)<br/> <br/> Because of our limitations in this universe and our bodies, we have to choose what parts of Everything we are going to be. <br/> <br/> Who do you want to be? Cuz I see a lot of Jesus-loving people that spew a lot of Hitler-emulating hate on this app. ￼</div><div></div></div>
