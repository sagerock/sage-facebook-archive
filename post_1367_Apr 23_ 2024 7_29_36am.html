Roscoe came into our lives in a peculiar way. Jeff was spending time with a woman who had Roscoe. They spent the day together. Then the woman just left. And Roscoe was with Jeff. 

Things like this happen in the homeless community. On one hand, they look like random, coincidental events. On the other hand, they feel like they were meant to be. They feel cosmic. Like the universe felt that Jeff needed a friend. And the universe gave him Roscoe. 

Dogs are more than humans deserve. They are clearly better than us. Roscoe has a back story none of us know. But right now Jeff is his all time best friend. They are inseparable. 

I love having dogs around my homeless friends. They have no judgment. They are pure happiness and love. 

Roscoe will likely move on at some point.  But right now he is a super special part of our community.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
