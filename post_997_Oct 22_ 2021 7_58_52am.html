            <div class="_2pin"><div>All bigots are racists. But not all people who do and say racist things are bigots. <br/> <br/> We need a word that points out actions and behaviors that hurt people racially yet is not accusatory. "Racist" is probably that word. <br/> <br/> Saying that people from the middle east are family-oriented is racist. (that's not based on fact. It's just a generalization. They're probably no more or less family-oriented than other groups of people. )<br/> <br/> Saying African Americans are less than white people is bigoted (and racist). It comes from a place of hate and self-righteous superiority.  Most humans understand that this is ignorant as fuck.<br/> <br/> The unknowing, and even well-meaning, racist acts and words are the real threat.</div><div></div></div>
