As I get further into the reality of homelessness I have a feeling I could be banned from more places.

I just did an AMAZING interview with Patty. Patty and I have been friends for about 8 years. We have seen a lot of stuff together.

Patty wanted to do this interview in response to me getting banned from TikTok. 

We discuss a lot of topic that I don't think I can even mention here. 

You can find the audio version of the interview here:
