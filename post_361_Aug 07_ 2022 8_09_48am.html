Unc is the Secretary and Silly is the Vice President of the @[109672538495516:274:Church of the Nomadic Spirit]. 

They are both homeless at the moment. 

Unc was in the bar business in Sandusky and is a veteran. Silly is a young guy from the streets of Akron. Both are incredibly smart and thoughtful. 

The minute they got these roles everything changed. They saw their surroundings in a completely different way. They instantly saw a community that they wanted to care for and respect. 

I am an absolute evangelist for Community. I believe it is the bedrock of what it means to be a human. It creates roles that need filled. It builds connection with fellow humans. 

Unc pointed out to me recently that in America we don’t Assimilate we Eliminate. You either do exactly what you are told and be just like everyone else or your community will be broken up and probably illegalized. 

In this era of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice we still have MUCH work to do. If people aren’t hurting anyone LEAVE THEM ALONE.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
