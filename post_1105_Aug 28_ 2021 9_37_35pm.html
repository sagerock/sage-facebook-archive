            <div class="_2pin"><div>Can't you imagine how 500 Afghans coming into Akron who will get everything for free, feels for the the 26% of the population living below the poverty line, for the 40% of kids living below the poverty line, for ALL the people who have been evicted in the Ohio city with the most evictions, for all the moms who can't afford their water bill. It's not an anti-refugee stance... It's that no one cares about the countless people in Akron who are legitimately suffering. They are left with nothing while these new 500 Akronites just won an all expenses paid trip to live in America.</div><div></div></div>
