            <div class="_2pin"><div>I have decided that every time I put something painful out I'm going to send out 10 warm thoughts to remind you that the great truth is that you and your fellow human brothers and sisters are so good and so kind and truly amazing. You prevail in the face of adversity against all odds. <br/> <br/> You often walk through the valley of the shadow of death. And yes, sometimes you do fear evil. But that's what makes you all the more incredible. No matter how much fear, no matter how much pain, no matter how much suffering... You just keep walking. <br/> <br/> You are wonderful. You are beautiful. You are the inspiration that pushes me forward to stand up for the basic rights of all American citizens. <br/> <br/> Thank you. <br/> <br/> (That's 1)</div><div></div></div>
