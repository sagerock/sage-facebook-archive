He said he was thirsty. I happened to have one bottle of water. I apologized that was all I had. He thanked me and immediately took the water and tossed it to this guy on the road. Ricky said they needed it more than him.

I see homeless people doing this kind of thing all the time. But it never ceases to shake me to my core. A thirsty person giving his only bottle of water to a thirstier person. Can you even imagine?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
