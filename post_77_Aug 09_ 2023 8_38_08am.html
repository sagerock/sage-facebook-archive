            <div class="_2pin"><div>Now that we voted no on Issue 1, we are going to spend the next few months talking about abortion and whether or not we should make a state constitution amendment to allow women to make their own choices about their reproductive rights (at least until the baby is viable.)<br/> <br/> I am a vehement supporter of women's rights. I support abortion. And if the state wants to remove a baby after it is viable and take care of it, that is fine, as long as it's not a major burden to the woman.<br/> <br/> THAT SAID... We on the left must strive to use this opportunity to listen to and understand our conservative friends. They are SO important in our country. They often grow our food, fight our wars, and take care of us in most first responder areas. And honestly, they are some of the most generous, kind and loving people I've ever met. <br/> <br/> We cannot allow the politicians to play with our minds and convince us that we are enemies of each other. WE ARE NOT ENEMIES. <br/> <br/> I am a huge supporter of helping pregnant women along the way with their decision on whether or not to keep their baby. Personally, I just think we should pay women to have babies (and before you say that is immoral, just know that adoption agencies ALL make their money on babies. Babies make adoption agencies rich. We should just give the money to the mothers instead.)<br/> <br/> I've never known a pregnant homeless woman to want an abortion. But they sure will be left to fend for themselves in the woods all winter long with zero support. <br/> <br/> WE ALL NEED TO BE DOING MORE. I'd like to see less abortions. I think that would be a good thing, overall. But not against the mother's wishes. <br/> <br/> This divisive hate is fabricated because it helps Democrats and Republicans stay in power. And it makes corporate news outlets super rich. <br/> <br/> If we would stop letting the 2 political parties warp our minds with their evil brainwashing that tells us to hate each other I truly believe the people of America would come together on a plan that works for everyone.</div><div></div></div>
