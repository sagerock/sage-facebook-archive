            <div class="_2pin"><div>2 women who were living in one of the camps that is being swept by City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office tomorrow are moving onto Houseless Movement Group  land in their truck. I will have a maximum of 2 tents, 1 tiny house and a safe parking area for one vehicle to show a variety of examples of alternative living lifestyles. <br/> <br/> I don't know if they are a couple. But if they are that explains why they can't move to a shelter. A gay couple (or any couple for that matter) has no place in Akron to shelter together. <br/> <br/> The idea that the ONLY way to live is the way Dan Horrigan tells you to live is disgusting.</div><div></div></div>
