            <div class="_2pin"><div>I am currently studying Forgiveness. <br/> <br/> Forgiveness is an advanced placement course because it can seem like Acceptance. <br/> <br/> Forgiveness is not acceptance of injustice. Forgiveness is not giving up and allowing oppression. <br/> <br/> Forgiveness is letting go of hatred and anger. Forgiveness is standing against what is wrong while having love and compassion for the wrong doer. <br/> <br/> I am in a unique position to show love and forgiveness while standing up for justice. <br/> <br/> I hope to write more about this later.</div><div></div></div>
