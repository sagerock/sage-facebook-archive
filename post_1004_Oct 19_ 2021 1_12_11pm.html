            <div class="_2pin"><div>Christian Aid Ministries in Berlin Ohio (about an hour away from Akron) is the group that organized the mission of 17 people kidnapped in Haiti on Saturday. <br/> <br/> Kidnappings are very common in Haiti right now because there is so much poverty and upheaval. <br/> <br/> Christian Aid Ministries is a multi-multi million dollar organization that covered up an employee who molested boys in both Ohio and Haiti between 1998 and 2008.<br/> <br/> The kidnappers want $1 million for each person. <br/> <br/> I set that entire stage so you can sit in the goop and mess that is humanity. <br/> <br/> The kidnappers, the Amish, the Mennonites... all guilty and innocent simultaneously. <br/> <br/> And there is a 2-year-old "missionary" sitting in Haiti who was taken on a mission to hell on earth who is now a pawn in an international fight between countless evil organizations. <br/> <br/> This is a metaphor for life as a human being.</div><div></div></div>
