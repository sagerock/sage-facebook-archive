Let me help you with your sermons and homilies this weekend. 

JUST DON'T BOTHER. 

You are no better than these cops that sat around drinking water talking about what they would do to that shooter but actually didn't. 

I remember going to a church service during that hot second you all were so upset about suffering children on our southern border. Do you remember that time? They're still down there by the way. The minister was so upset. He had everyone come up during the sermon and look at pictures of kids suffering in those camps. That's all they did. 

You're not going to do anything this time either. So stop pretending you are. Talk about anything other than all those "precious" little babies that had to die senselessly. It's a waste of your breath. I'd rather hear about what you're going to cook out on Memorial Day because that's the only action you're going to be taking.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
