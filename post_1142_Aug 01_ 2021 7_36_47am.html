Thanks to you, I was able to give her a tent that she desperately needed. 

Thanks to @[139561179458303:274:City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office] and @[100791901503017:274:Summit County Continuum of Care] I am not able to safely shelter her on my own private property with private money. 

Akron is experiencing all time record murders. The streets are on fire with rage right now. And as you can see, she's wearing a mask praying that she won't get the Delta variation of Covid. How safe would you feel as a single woman living on the streets of Akron right now?

I sometimes feel like I'm the only sane person in the middle of a murderous insane asylum where even the handlers have gone mad.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
