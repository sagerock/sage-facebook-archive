            <div class="_2pin"><div>My Communist friends will be sad to know this truth: most homeless people are very conservative... both black and white. They often exhibit racist and homophobic characteristics... and sex offenders, forget about it. They ALL hate sex offenders.<br/> <br/> My Conservative friends will be sad to know this truth: Most homeless people want to be just like you: gun carrying capitalists. They get an unlimited supply of guns from the Hartville Flea Market (No background check required.) Drug dealers are nothing more than perfect Capitalists. No regulations. No government oversight. Free to collect money the old fashioned way... through violence. Just tax-free money. And when the liberal government picks up one drug dealer it's a huge opportunity for a man or woman just waiting for their opportunity to step into the spot.<br/> <br/> Poverty and homelessness challenge us all in very unique and difficult ways. <br/> <br/> As individuals we can't make systemic changes to any of these foundational issues. We can only do one thing: Practice unconditional love. It's not our place to hate or judge. It does no good. It just grows toxic energy in your body and mind. Let go. Just love and forget all the rest.</div><div></div></div>
