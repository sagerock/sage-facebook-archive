Several homeless people have worked incredibly hard at cleaning up this church. We have hauled countless truckloads of trash out of that church and driven it to my dumpster in Middlebury. 

Pastor Aulden Knight spent $15,000 to put a new roof on this church after he bought it from another pastor. 

He comes over and mows the lawn every week. 

Both Pastor Knight and the homeless people working on the church want the same thing: a place for the community to come together for fellowship and love and positivity. 

When Pastor Knight went to the county to get a permit to do some work to get the utilities turned on he was told he doesn’t own the church. The Land Bank owns the church. (That’s not what it says on the online Parcel Viewer.)

Yesterday the city boarded up the church (while 3 people were still in it.)</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
