We don't have police. We don't have ridiculous rules. And you know what happens? You're going to be surprised to hear this. But it turns out homeless people are just people. They aren't criminals. They aren't ignorant. They are just people.

They eat food. They hang out with their dog. They smoke cigarettes. They drink coffee. They do people things. 

They are people. They are people. They are people.

Our diversity equity and inclusion practices must include homeless people. Otherwise you haven't learned a single lesson.

When you make rules for homeless people they need to be the exact same rules you would make for a person who was not homeless. Otherwise it's bigotry.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
