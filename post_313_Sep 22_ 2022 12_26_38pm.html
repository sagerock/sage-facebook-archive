            <div class="_2pin"><div>Apparently some homeless people have been telling Akron police that I have women chained up in my building or house or someplace. <br/> <br/> I have a really good contact at APD that let me know this. He's been in my properties before and said that there is a very low level of suspicion. <br/> <br/> But he asked me if I'd like him to go through my properties to "check off that box". I told him I would LOVE that. I will show the police anything they want to see any time any where. I literally don't do anything illegal (not even so much as smoke a joint. I'm straight edge.)<br/> <br/> FOR THE RECORD: I do not have anyone chained or locked anywhere. I don't like putting my dog in a crate.<br/> <br/> I am happy to have the police gps monitor my travels, listen to my phone calls, go into any of my properties. Whatever. I am an open book.<br/> <br/> He then asked me, "Why would they say that about you?"<br/> <br/> I have been accused of every imaginable crime by homeless people. It usually happens because I make them mad for one reason or another. And then they just start saying stuff. <br/> <br/> I AM NOT A CRIMINAL. I can't think one single thing I do that is illegal. My wife even gets annoyed that I follow the speed limit. "Arrive alive" is my motto. <br/> <br/> I will keep you up to date on this issue.</div><div></div></div>
