There is a lot that goes on in them. The good picture is them at their best. And the bad picture is them at their worst. 

But this is the before and after of my friend Chrissy who got picked up in a motel in Springfield with 11 meth pipes, 2 machetes and a bunch of meth. 

According to the National Institutes of Health, the average age of death for a homeless man is 56.27 years old and 52.00 years old for a homeless woman. This is 30 years younger than the average age of death for the general population, which is 77 years.

Chrissy is 51 right now. According to the statistics she has 1 year left to live. You can kind of see it.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
