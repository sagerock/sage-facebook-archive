It's one of the few approved graphing calculators that you can use on the SAT and ACT. (Your phone can graph. But you can't use that.)

It cost $125 on Amazon. I've bought several expensive books and online courses that are hundreds of dollars each.

Who do you think will do better on the SAT and ACT? My son who can afford all this bullshit? Or one of the 40% of Akron kids who live below the poverty line and can't afford food?

These tests are the gateways into good colleges. And it is a proven fact that Asian kids and white kids do better on them. But it's not because they are smarter or that their parents "prioritize education.". IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE RICH.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
