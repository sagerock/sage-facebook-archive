(the media doesn't seem to be posting it and we need to be told the truth as a community.)

They brought guns into the school and then brazenly took a picture of them holding the guns and posted it on instagram.

My kid is a junior at Firestone. We were soft-peddled this lockdown with a phone announcement. 

You'll see the city jumping all over this because Firestone is the crown jewel of Akron City Schools. And, as always, we'll be left wondering if East High School would have gotten the same response (they wouldn't).

This has nothing to do with poor parenting or poor social values in these kids' neighborhoods. This has to do with the suffering of inner-city people. The rich are getting richer and the poor are living like unwanted rats in the sewers of America.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
