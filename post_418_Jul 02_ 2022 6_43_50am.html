            <div class="_2pin"><div>It’s time to expand our thinking about who cops love to kill. YES. They get a hard-on for killing Black men. But the truth is larger than that. <br/> <br/> It’s not just Black men. IT’S ALL POOR MEN. <br/> <br/> “Police violence is focused overwhelmingly on men lowest on the socio-economic ladder: in rural areas outside the South, predominately white men; in the Southwest, disproportionately Hispanic men; in mid-size and major cities, disproportionately black men. Significantly, in the rural South, where the population is racially mixed, white men and black men are killed by police at nearly identical rates. What unites these victims of police violence is not their race, but their class status (as well as, of course, their gender).”</div><div></div></div>
