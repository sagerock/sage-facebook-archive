The man looking at us is Fox. The man in the orange hat is John. 

Fox is mentally very sound. John is very mentally ill. 

Both are VERY strong mentally and physically. 

I believe the streets of America have forged Black men, in particular, into granite. 

Look how Fox controls John, just with his words. It’s so impressive. I can’t do that. All I do with John is de-escalation. ￼

I’m not really sure what John did. But if I had to guess, I’d say it had to do with John attacking someone over some belonging that John thought was his. John believes, because he has lived infinite past, present and future lives, everything belongs to him. 

I’d really like to interview both of these men. They are truly interesting and powerful.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
