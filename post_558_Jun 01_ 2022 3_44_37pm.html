I've talked to you about him before. He's a veteran that first moved to our place in a tent and then I moved him into our house. 

One of the things I've never shared with you is that I never charged him rent. I have 3 rooms I rent for $300 each. He lived in our house close to 3 years rent free. 

There are 2 groups of homeless people I simply can't stand seeing live on the streets of the richest country in America: veterans and pregnant women. ($40 billion to Ukraine and American veterans live on the streets. You can be sure that irony is not lost on a single one of them.)

He has been diagnosed with cancer. He has a large tumor in his right arm. He is going to lose the arm. 

But the positive side of it is that the VA is currently putting him in a hotel as they work on getting him housing. They are also getting his social security benefits for him. I think things will be getting better for him. 

I am now renting the room to a senior citizen whose house burned down in the last month. He's been living in a tent with us for the last month or so  He can afford the $300 on his social security benefits. 

This is going to significantly help our financial situation. 

But I am SO thankful we never had to evict Mike because we were out of money. That was all thanks to you. I never would have been able to keep Mike all this time in the house without you. 

I will be forever grateful to you.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
