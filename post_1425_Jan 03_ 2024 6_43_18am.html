He has been my guard dog for the last few weeks after I had a significant break in. 

I had to kick him and all people out of the building because one of our homeless friends didn’t like the way we were running things so they called the police on us multiple times with the intention of shutting it all down. 

I can often hate people. But I never can hate a dog.  

Nino has been scratching and barking at my door wanting to get back in for the last 2 days. I’ve been watching him on my security camera. 

It’s one of the more tragic things I’ve had to watch. 

Why is that? Why do I have nothing but sympathy and love for a dog? But I have to be some sort of enlightened, spiritual guru to find even the slightest amount of compassion for a human?

I mean Nino is not perfect. Far from it. I once tried to physically redirect him as he was peeing on a chair in my building. He snapped at me. I immediately learned Nino can pee wherever Nino wants. I have no interest in doing hand-to-mouth combat with my pit-bull guard dog. 

I don’t blame those chimpanzees that rip their owners’ faces off for wearing the wrong color hair tie one bit. You should have been more careful. 

But I can existentially hate a human being for praying to the “wrong” form of Santa Clause. 

Is it just ancient tribal instinct?

Whatever it is, we have to get over it. And fast. We ALL need each other on the planet right now. We are dealing with global consequences of our actions. 

On top of that, we have been living with the wisdom of Jesus and Buddha and the Bhagavad-Gita for thousands of years. We know the path. We need to start walking it.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
