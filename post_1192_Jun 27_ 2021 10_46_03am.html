This extreme tragedy is an opportunity for us to learn and grow in compassion and understanding particularly in the Northeast Ohio community. 

But instead, pundits and people on Facebook will say something like, "We need more mental health resources," (which we do) and that will be that. Nothing will change. No paradigm shift of thinking will occur.

We'll just keep "sending up our prayers" as brutal tragedies happen over and over again because of a system that has very few safety nets and the nets we do have are often guarded by paperwork and endless bureaucracy. The system will not change for the suffering of its people. It only changes for money, and it usually changes for the worse.

I'm so terribly sorry.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
