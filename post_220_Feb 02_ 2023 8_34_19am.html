If you see this message and you want to schedule a time please message me.<br/> <br/> All of us still have to have our signatures validate. So it's very likely some of these people will not make it past the signature validation step. We'll learn that within the next 2 week. <br/> <br/> Some people will drop out. But their name will still be on the ballot, if they make it past the signature validation step.<br/> <br/> Some of us are running for office primarily to help make Akron a better place. Some of us are running for office primarily for the power and glory. All of us have some mix of both motivations. <br/> <br/> Democracy is a mess. <br/> <br/> The kind of person that runs for political office is narcissistic, has an overblown ego of self-importance and has a certain amount of mental illness. I'd love to know how many of us have significant "love me daddy" issues. <br/> <br/> But who else is going to run for office? Anyone in their right mind will take a pass on this. Who needs all the personal scrutiny and public whoring that is required to run for office? Only people that have some deep hole of need-to-be-loved in their soul, that's who.<br/> <br/> A well-centered person would have absolutely no interest in this path.<br/> <br/> BUT GOD BLESS US INSANE PEOPLE THAT DO THIS!<br/> <br/> If no one would run for office Democracy literally could not exist.<br/> <br/> Just because a person is a narcissist, soulfully needy and has a massive ego does not make them bad. They're just screwed up in a certain way. We're all screwed up on planet Earth. How could we not be? Have you seen this place?<br/> <br/> A person with significant emotional need won't find contentment by winning one election. Nothing external ever actually fills that hole. And we're too insecure to truly believe that we can fill that hole ourselves by working on actual self-acceptance and personal love of who we are.<br/> <br/> So they'll work their ass off to continue to get people to love them. They'll be constantly looking around for someone, ANYONE, to tell them they are doing a good job. <br/> <br/> All the people on this list will work hard and do the best they can. Don't question their commitment to Akron or whether or not they are a good or bad person. They will do their best going down a path that they feel is best for the city. That is the absolute truth. No narcissist wants to go down in history as being a person who did a terrible job and was out to destroy the city. That isn't how it works. <br/> <br/> We all just have different ideas about how to make Akron better. Honestly, who knows what will actually work and what won't. There are infinite variables that play into all this. Most good leaders just got lucky for being in the right place at the right time with the right idea.<br/> <br/> And this takes me to you.<br/> <br/> In a Democracy it is actually YOU that leads this entire mess. YOU have to decide who is the right person for the job right now. <br/> <br/> There is incredible importance on picking the right person. Unfortunately, you are so busy with the million other things in your life that it's hard to fit in being a Democracy scholar on the side. BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY.<br/> <br/> Some of you are amazing at understanding the nuances of all these people. Most people aren't. <br/> <br/> Those of you that are well educated in all this PLEASE share your thoughts and reasons with people in person and on social media. Your insight matters. (You are the few people that have read this far in this post :)<br/> <br/> DON'T BE AFRAID TO FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY. <br/> <br/> Talk about politics. We need more talk about politics ESPECIALLY LOCALLY. <br/> <br/> Let me finish by saying: Thank you for all of you that had the courage to stand up for this Democratic process in Akron. It's amazing that you have done it. It's incredibly brave of you to run for political office. Good luck and may the best person for the job win.</div><div></div></div>
