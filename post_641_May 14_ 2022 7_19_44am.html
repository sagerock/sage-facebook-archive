            <div class="_2pin"><div>On the street everyone needs one good cop and one good drug dealer. <br/> <br/> Both can be challenging to come by. But they exist. <br/> <br/> A good cop will look past small issues like possession to stay focused on things like arson, grand theft auto and violent crime. They also won't run every name in a car or tent just because they can. They stay focused on serious crimes. <br/> <br/> A good drug dealer will not trap you in debt, will make a serious effort to sell clean drugs, will work on trade and will not bully you because the power went to their head. <br/> <br/> These are basic bonds of trust that need to be developed in order to weave a community back together. <br/> <br/> If you are terrified of every authority figure around you the entire world feels like an insane war zone.</div><div></div></div>
