This is me doing these 8 exercises for 45 seconds each with a 15 second break in between each one. We did that cycle for 3 rounds. I’ll show you my before and after pictures after it’s all over. 

I am really leaning into the necessity of suffering in our lives. For some of us we have to suffer to get stronger through paying some British guy to make us move around and eat right. For some other people all they have to do is wake up. They are tortured by extreme mental illness, addiction and homelessness. 

Either way, we are both learning powerful lessons through struggle and fighting and suffering. 

I can’t recommend enough the book, Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl. It takes you on a wild spiritual journey. 

Hard work and struggle. They are these terrible gifts that seem to give us the most meaning in our lives.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
