It's seen the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico and several Great Lakes. It's been to Yellow Stone National Park and just outside Washington DC. We have had a lot of great adventures with it. 

But this year we decided we are going to retire the camper. When I asked the family what they wanted to do with it, they said they wanted to give it to a homeless person.

So, now it's on another adventure. It will serve as (illegal) shelter for someone who needs it. I'll tell you more about that at another time.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
