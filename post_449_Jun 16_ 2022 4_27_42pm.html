Everyone (except for one) at the camp said they don’t believe trafficking is going on. They all said that some women will occasionally sell sexual services. But they weren’t trafficked. The officer said he didn’t know the specifics of the situation. <br/> <br/> There was one person who lives at the camp who had a different story. We will call her Raven. <br/> <br/> Raven said that there was indeed trafficking going on. She said it was Celeste (also a made up name). <br/> <br/> I was told that Raven called the police. She has denied that. But she also slept in her tent untouched through the entire raid. She was never bothered during the raid.<br/> <br/> If the accusation was that there was sex trafficking going on and the only person who says there’s sex trafficking is Raven and Raven slept through the raid, I think there is a good likelihood that she called￼ the police. <br/> <br/> Raven and Celeste have a very tumultuous relationship. Raven believes that Celeste has repeatedly stolen from her. When I left the camp today Raven was going through Celeste’s tent looking for her belongings that she believed Celeste had stolen from her.￼<br/> <br/> Raven does not tell me that she was trafficked. Only that she has seen trafficking happen. And Celeste was doing it.<br/> <br/> I do also know for a fact that Raven has had at least one man pay for sex herself. That’s fine. But I think it needs to be included in the story.￼<br/> <br/> Celeste has left the camp. And Raven says she is leaving the camp today.￼<br/> <br/> Celeste definitely has a history of pimping women. Celeste also has a very controversial background in many many things.<br/> <br/> Many people have told me that they thought I should not shelter Celeste because of her known actions.<br/> <br/> ￼ I don’t know if Celeste was trafficking women or not. It is certainly possible. But Celeste and I talk regularly and I never got a sense that she was doing that. She has always been very open with me about her thoughts and actions.<br/> <br/> ￼ I genuinely hope that this gets more thoroughly investigated. And I also surely hope that the people in jail get help as well. I was told earlier today that some people were already out of jail and back at the camp. The people living at the camp said that they had not seen anyone return from jail yet.<br/> <br/> This is a tricky situation because if Raven truly believed that Celeste was trafficking people then she certainly should’ve called the police. But the fact that Raven genuinely does not like Celeste makes it potentially possible￼￼ ￼that this was an act of revenge.￼</div><div></div></div>
