Here's one of the stories:
a youth minister at Garland Baptist Church in Texas named Derek Wayne Hutter, who pleaded guilty in 2015 to charges of enticement of a minor and was sentenced to 264 months in federal prison. The Dallas Morning News reported that authorities said he had convinced a 13-year-old girl in his youth group to have sex with him 20 times, at the church and at Mr. Hutterâ€™s home..

I know. I know. It's hard to believe a place where a person would go for safety and spiritual guidance is actually a place of rape and mental torture of children. I'm sure you've never heard of something so unbelievable as that before. 

(The more I look around, the more all I see is a world of leaders and institutions that have done nothing other than betray and hurt the people they supposedly said they were going to protect.)

FUCK THE GOVERNMENT. 
FUCK THE POLICE. 
FUCK THE CHURCH. 

The people of America deserve so much better than the steaming pile of shit that you all are.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
