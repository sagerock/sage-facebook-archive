She and her husband have a garden and raise bees. 

She brought a box of this homemade honey and a bunch of other beautiful items for homeless people in Akron. 

Homemade honey is love manifest. 

This is so kind and caring and beautifully giving. 

Love is the answer. It has always been the answer. And we all know it is the answer. 

Yet we are afraid to let go of our fear and anxiety and cruelty. What if those are the adult drivers of safety and protection? That love is just a childish fantasy?

Look around. How is war and fear and greed working out for the world? Is it making you feel more safe? It certainly isn’t for me. ￼

Fear begets more fear. 

And I’m here to tell you… love begets more love. 

Thank you so much, Laura, for this wonderful gift for homeless people. This is how the world transforms… one jar of honey at a time.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
