            <div class="_2pin"><div>I have said very little about Israel and Palestine. <br/> <br/> Part of that was because I didn’t feel like I was knowledgeable enough on the topic. Another part is that watching other people’s posts on the topic, they don’t look very popular. I suspect this is such a hot button issue that most people are afraid to say anything. A close friend of mine won’t even disclose to me what he believes through email because he’s concerned of surveillance and his job. <br/> <br/> It seems that one of the oppressed victims of this modern day struggle is the freedom of speech. <br/> <br/> The day after the gruesome attack on Israel I wrote here that I stand with Israel. A couple people said they were going to unfollow me and that was the end of the discussion. <br/> <br/> I still stand with Israel. I don’t stand with their actions. But I stand with Israel. They are possibly the most oppressed people of all time. They deserve to live in peace. Unfortunately they are the children of a history that taught them that mite makes right and they seem to have learned that lesson all too well. <br/> <br/> But I never got to finish my thought on the topic that day. <br/> <br/> I also stand with Palestine. I don’t stand with their actions. But I stand with their right to have the same freedoms as any other people. <br/> <br/> The Israeli government seems to still carry with it the position of being the underdog all while having nuclear weapons, the most sophisticated defense system on the planet and pretty much a blank check and unconditional support from the United States. <br/> <br/> We have 2 groups of people that feel hated by the rest of the world and by their neighbors. What would you do in their situation?<br/> <br/> If I was the leader of Hamas or Israel, I am ashamed to say: I probably wouldn’t do much different from exactly what is going on. <br/> <br/> Terrorism is the main weapon of poor people. Tanks and artillery are the main weapons of rich people. Innocent men, women and children die because they got in the way with either form of combat. <br/> <br/> Today, I feel most pain for the Palestinian people. The mass suffering they are experiencing is beyond imagination. <br/> <br/> Calling for a cease fire is the smartest choice. It doesn’t pick sides. It just stops the hemorrhaging. <br/> <br/> Eventually the mass murders will stop for a moment. And then the real challenge will begin. I simply can’t see how these people are ever going to live together in peace. I simply can’t imagine it happening. <br/> <br/> But I do know this: Oppression only ends when the people with all the power decide it will stop. <br/> <br/> You can’t really deny that the Gaza Strip is a terribly oppressed place. I understand why Israel feels it is necessary. But making more suffering and more oppression, which is what they are doing today, is only going to make the Palestinians more enraged. <br/> <br/> Today it looks like Hamas is winning. Israel fell into their trap. More terrorists are being created, Israel is looking worse in the eyes of their Muslim neighbors and the United States is getting taken down with them. <br/> <br/> Yes. Hamas needs to go. And so does Netanyahu. But the flames of hatred are burning brighter than ever. I can’t see an empathetic, compassionate leader coming to either side for a very long time, if ever. <br/> <br/> Keep calling for a cease fire. It’s the only answer today.</div><div></div></div>
