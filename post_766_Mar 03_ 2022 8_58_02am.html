            <div class="_2pin"><div>Did you know...<br/> If you are a current or past alcoholic you have a disability and are a protected class.<br/> <br/> You are also considered disabled if you are a former illegal drug user. <br/> <br/> But you are NOT a protected class if you are currently using illegal drugs. <br/> <br/> ****<br/> We have a very clear double standard going on. Using one mind altering drug is no different than using any other mind altering drug. It's just that German and Irish Americans got their drug protected in the constitution because it was making them rich.</div><div></div></div>
