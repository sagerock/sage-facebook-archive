The person didn’t get in. But they made a really good effort. I know it was a homeless friend of mine. It was 20 degrees last night. And behind that door was heat, Internet, and a full bathroom. I can’t let homeless people in my building because it’s illegal to let people sleep in a building that isn’t zoned and approved for sleeping. They will shut down my entire building if I let people in. It’s not a problem that my lock is broken. That makes sense. The problem is that America is broken. I want to shelter people who have no shelter and it’s illegal for me to do so. And it’s not just homeless people we cruelly neglect. It’s all people. Look around. You’ll see that they don’t care about you or anyone.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
