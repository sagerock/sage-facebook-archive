            <div class="_2pin"><div>My Firestone High School junior has the ACT test coming up in March. <br/> <br/> You absolutely, positively must study for these standardized tests. And it's a massive test covering a massive amount of concepts and material. <br/> <br/> Covid made these tests optional at many schools. It is my hope that they stay optional. If you are great at these tests then by all means submit the score. If not, don't stress about it.</div><div></div></div>
