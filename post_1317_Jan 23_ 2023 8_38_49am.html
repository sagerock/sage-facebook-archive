The people are meant to govern themselves in America... not the inside, elite. Please join me at my fundraiser to push this campaign over the edge. 

The people have always had the power. The powerful have just tried to convince us differently. We are the truth. We are freedom. We are our own salvation.

PLEASE JOIN ME AT MY FUNDRAISER FOR MY CAMPAIGN TO WIN WARD 8 AKRON CITY COUNCIL. 

Money is not required. We can come for free, if you are low on funds right now. 

Please just go here to register so I can get a feel for how many people are coming:

Where: Mercedes Neighborhood Tavern at 1947 W Market St #103, Akron (Behind CVS)

When: Thursday, January 26 from 6-8 pm.

As a small business owner, I LOVE entrepreneurs and small businesses. I stopped by Mercedes Neighborhood Tavern at 1947 W Market St #103, Akron and immediately fell in love with it.

This is next to Niko's Sandwich Board (which is amazing). It's behind CVS.

I got to meet Cindy Christman, the tavern's proprietor. She is so kind and wonderful. You are going to LOVE her if you come to this event.

THE PEOPLE CAN FIX AKRON. Please join me in the People's Movement of Akron Ohio. </div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
