            <div class="_2pin"><div>I've been working on trying to get my houseless friends to trust the police more. <br/> <br/> An outsider just came through and beat up 3 people in the Houseless Movement Garden. They just called me as what to do about it. I told them to call the police. It's such a foreign idea to them it never even occurred to them. <br/> <br/> They hung up the phone and called the police. That's pretty impressive. <br/> <br/> We are all so divided that building trust in "the other" is very challenging.</div><div></div></div>
