This is particularly brutal because in class warfare this isn't supposed to happen to a family like this. With his stainless steel appliances and Polo button down shirt, he should be immune to the ravages of street drugs. 

"Rauh's civil complaint followed a federal investigation that was sparked by the death of his son Tommy Rauh, 37, who became addicted to painkillers after being prescribed opioids by a doctor following a rollerblading accident. Like many others at the time, Tommy Rauh eventually moved on to heroin and battled addiction for 10 years until he died in March 2015 after injecting fentanyl."

Jim Rauh's plan is to make fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction. I assume that will mean that we will then be able to go to war with people in China and Mexico that deliver these drugs. 

My idea is to just make it all legal. I had a friend (who died of an overdose) that would cut the fentanyl he was selling with various items by using a kitchen mixer. He knew it was dangerous because it wasn't mixing properly. But that's all he had. 

But I certainly appreciate Jim's rage. 

The truth is: I'm not going to get my wish and neither is Jim. 

Nothing is going to change. Once I saw all those dead 6 and 7 year olds (Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people. Twenty of the victims were children between six and seven years old, and the other six were adult staff members at Sandy Hook.) I learned something very important. 

WE ARE ALL LEFT TO FEND FOR OURSELVES OUT HERE ON THE STREETS OF AMERICA. No one is coming to help us. 

If we won't do one single thing to protect our 6 year olds then what hope does Jim Rauh have for the murder of his 37 year old son?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
