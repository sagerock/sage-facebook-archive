Someone had knocked it off its stand. 

But check it out! It's back up better than ever.

I might try putting a camera on it to make sure it doesn't get messed with again. 

But the lesson is: some people in the world find overt kindness hard to understand. It's too powerful so it must be destroyed. I see it all the time. The power of hate and fear is SO strong. But love must never give up. Love is hope. Love is God. Faith Love and Hope are the powers that must prevail. 

Thank you!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
