            <div class="_2pin"><div>Ever since a Black homeless friend asked me if I was ever worried my business would get hurt by being accused of being a "Nigger Lover" (his words; not mine), I've been thinking about racism on a whole new level.<br/> <br/> Our house at 85 Kent Place is now all Black. All the tenants. And all the people that hang out in the basement. The only White people I see there are a few White women. White men simply do not go in that house any more.<br/> <br/> I've always had rumors spread about me. But they seem more intense right now. That I have women chained up in the basement of someplace. That I am selling laced drugs to homeless people and killing them. <br/> <br/> I kind of think that this change in racial makeup of the 85 Kent Place house could be contributing to that.<br/> <br/> It's not Black people saying this stuff about me. It's White people. <br/> <br/> I believe that lower income communities are a little behind-the-times in racial thinking. (Homophobic thinking too. But that's another story.)<br/> <br/> But it's not just homeless people. It's laborers I hire. It's people that don't live in Akron that come into Akron to work. It's family members with "traditional values."<br/> <br/> I'm sure some of you will think that this is "sad" or "tragic". I don't. I think of it as cultural. I find it extremely interesting.<br/> <br/> Prisons are very racially segregated. And let's face it, most of our communities are racially segregated. A huge portion of America is feeling something about race and it's typically not positive. <br/> <br/> I am a firm believer in talking about racism (and everything else). You are not bad for thinking and feeling a certain way. Your thoughts and feelings are legitimate and likely come from a place that makes sense based on your upbringing and community culture.</div><div></div></div>
