He had moved from another seat to this seat to intimidate an older Black man. Talking about All Lives Matter and the second amendment. 

He looked like he thought he was controlling the train. Telling the doors to open and close. Etc…

I believe the best way to manage someone like this is to de-escalate. Don’t engage. Don’t talk to him. 

The Black man did the right thing. He got up and left the train. His presence was clearly agitating this guy. 

These American city scenes infuriate me. They are a metaphor for how everything is a  cost benefit analysis in this decaying country. If the cost of doing something is greater than the cost of doing nothing then we will do nothing. Each person is a dollar sign. And doing anything is alway much more expensive than the number of people not doing something hurts. Murdering children in our schools is just the cost of doing business in America. 

Being targeted and terrified by guys like this on the train is just the cost of doing business in America.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Boston-Massachusetts/106003956105810" target="_blank">Boston, Massachusetts</a> (42.3577, -71.0565)</div><div>Address: Boston, MA</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
