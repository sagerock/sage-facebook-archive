We don't know what killed him. When we find out more I'll let you know. 

I'm heading there now and will share more information as soon as I get it.

Update:
I don't know if we'll ever know for sure what the cause of death was because we aren't next of kin. And no one seems to know if he has any family at all. But a friend of his said she talked to him on Monday. She said he was depressed and said he wanted to kill himself. If I find out anything more I will definitely let you know. 

Thank you all for caring about Andrew. Maybe one of the saddest things about homelessness is that you feel like not one single person on the entire Earth cares whether you live or die. Andrew had friends. Many people loved Andrew. That's very special. Thank you.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
