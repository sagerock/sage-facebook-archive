            <div class="_2pin"><div>The people I am drawn to care for are the hardest cases. If you are psychotic, drunk, addicted, thieving, conniving, ruthless... I am drawn to you. I want to help you. I don't want to fix you. I don't want to change you. I just want to help you live your life the way you want to live it.<br/> <br/> I can't always help these people because no one in any position of authority wants to help them. So, I am illegally sheltering them on one piece of land that I'm quite sure they will try to take away the slightest chance they get. I NEED MULTIPLE LOCATIONS to keep the most difficult people safe from others. <br/> <br/> The irony is: because no one is willing to help these people they make the ENTIRE COMMUNITY more dangerous and violent. Authority is complicit in the murders and dangers in society because they ignore the people they hate.</div><div></div></div>
