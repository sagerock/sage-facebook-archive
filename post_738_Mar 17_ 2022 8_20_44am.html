We've been racist since the beginning. Because of that, we have a HUGE amount of unwinding and healing to do to help our Black Akron neighbors even begin to start in a place of equality with everyone else. This existential damage will not be undone by a few platitudes and holidays. WE HAVE SERIOUS WORK TO DO.

In my administration, if a Black owned business or a Black job candidate is as good as another candidate THE BLACK CANDIDATE WILL GET THE JOB.
