He lived in the subsidized housing complex across the street from where we have done most of our homeless work.

Kelly would come over all the time. The homeless community was a very big part of his life. 

I would like to thank all of you (mostly homeless people) who spent so much time taking care of Kelly and being his friend. 

I think he had muscular dystrophy. He was just a regular person until he was about 18. Then he slowly became more and more disabled. 

He was interesting because if you first met him you couldn't understand what he was saying. But for some reason, as you would talk to him more you could start to understand him. Most of the homeless community could talk to him like he had no speech issue at all.

You all were a wonderful and important part of Kelly's life. Thank you for being so good to him.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
