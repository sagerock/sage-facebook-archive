They tell you very explicitly that you can give them fake information. Fake name. Fake birthday. Fake social security number. 

DID IT EVER OCCUR TO THEM that because I'm a well known person in Akron that I told them the correct name but lied about not using injection drugs? DID IT EVER OCCUR TO THEM that maybe I didn't want my name tied to a record where I admit to using injection drugs?

Apparently not. They were talking about me as a group (obviously my information is not confidential. Who knows who else gets it.) They determined that I am not an injection drug user because they know me. And meanwhile I have friends who go there to get needles and sell them for $20 per bag of 10 needles.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
