            <div class="_2pin"><div>I hope my conservative friends know I love and respect you. Your commitment and dedication to your beliefs and values is beautiful. <br/> <br/> As I find in myself, sometimes my greatest strength is also my greatest weakness. My activist, deconstruction drive makes much needed change. But it also creates hurt feelings and demoralization to those who are just trying their best. <br/> <br/> BE AWARE that your rightful desire to make your own choices about what drugs you put in your body doesn't bring down the entire health system. You are that powerful.</div><div></div></div>
