            <div class="_2pin"><div>When this whole sex trafficking at our tent city came up in the news I think many people instantly thought: "Sage did it!"<br/> <br/> I don't blame you in thinking that at all. You have been continually let down by your leaders. They all seem to be corrupt or evil or both. <br/> <br/> But that's not true. Those are just the ones that make the news.<br/> <br/> I have a cop friend that I want SO bad to tell you about. This guy could be from a super hero movie. He's SO great. But he doesn't want to be mentioned.<br/> <br/> I make a point of showing you all my sides. I rage with anger. I swear constantly. I give zero fucks what kind of drugs a person jams into their body. I am all about women making a buck with their bodies. I used to drink so much I was actually hoping I'd die from it.<br/> <br/> July 9 will be my 19 year anniversary for quitting drinking. I quit in 2003. After a DUI. After missing day after day of work. After being a dick to my family and friends. I finally quit. I've never touched it since.<br/> <br/> I am not a saint. I am every bit as human as everyone else here. In fact, I pride myself on my earthy humanity. I don't want to be a saint. I just want to be a good human.<br/> <br/> BUT THESE ARE FACTS ABOUT ME:<br/> I don't buy drugs.<br/> I don't sell drugs.<br/> I don't buy sex.<br/> I don't sell sex.<br/> <br/> Those are facts that are absolutely true. <br/> <br/> No one has contacted me from any police agency about this case. (The police officer friend I mentioned above called me yesterday about getting an ID for a homeless woman who stays with us. That's it. No one else.)<br/> <br/> But maybe they are going to eventually. And I will happily talk to them. <br/> <br/> If there was sex trafficking going on I want to know about it. I want it to end. I support women selling sex. I don't support exploiting women.<br/> <br/> I personally now don't think there was. I  believe it was Raven trying to hurt Celeste (2 fake named people I mentioned yesterday). I also heard Raven screaming that she was going to burn our camp to the ground. One time a homeless woman burned down our portapotty as she was leaving because we kicked her out. And another time a man reported people living in my building because "if he couldn't live there no one could." <br/> <br/> There is so much pain and suffering in the homeless community. Taking it out on others unfortunately sometimes happens. <br/> <br/> BUT ALL THAT SAID, I will gladly and happily work with anyone to go after someone that was trafficking a person. (And by trafficking I mean a person who forced a person to have sex against their will for money... and general variations on that theme.)<br/> <br/> I will always do my best to be as honest and truthful about who I am with you. You might not like what you see. But at least you'll know it's the truth.<br/> <br/> Have a great day.<br/> Sage</div><div></div></div>
