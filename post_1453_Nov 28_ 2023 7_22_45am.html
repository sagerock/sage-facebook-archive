She was extremely mentally ill. 

Have you ever had the opportunity to spend time with a delusional schizophrenic type of person before? It’s extremely interesting. They are physically in our world. But their mind is in a completely different universe and dimension. They see and hear things as clear as day that the rest of us can’t see and hear. And then it makes other mentally ill people start to amp up their anxiety and delusions. 

It makes you question everything. You can feel yourself slipping into insanity. It’s so strange.

But she was harmless. She didn’t want to hurt anyone. 

We have a little cat that comes around. They were hanging out together having a nice time.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
