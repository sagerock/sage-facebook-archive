I spend a lot of time working with homeless people to admit their truth, no matter what it is. Can SOMEONE from any place of authority admit that E.B. has fallen through every safety net in the book and has just had his tent and all his belongings taken from him by the city?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
