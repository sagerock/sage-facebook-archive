            <div class="_2pin"><div>I was out canvasing for my run for Akron's Ward 8 City Council seat and a police officer stopped.<br/> <br/> He said that he had been meaning to reach out to me because there is a group of homeless people that a land owner wants off his land. THE POLICE OFFICER DOES NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO WITH THESE PEOPLE OTHER THAN CONTACT ME.<br/> <br/> Over the years I've had MANY police officers, Parole Officers, and case workers of various sorts bring me homeless people because they don't know what else to do with them.<br/> <br/> Since City of Akron, Ohio - Mayor's Office is suing me for taking in homeless people that have nowhere else to go I am now forced to put homeless people on land that does not belong to me.<br/> <br/> You can love me or hate me. But I provide a service for the city because there simply is no other option for MANY people.</div><div></div></div>
