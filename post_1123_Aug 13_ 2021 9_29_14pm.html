We could easily do the same today with homeless Americans. 

“Now you tell me how can the plight of everybody on this Earth reach the halls of the United Nations,” Malcolm X said, his voice rising, “and you have twenty-two million Afro-Americans whose churches are being bombed, whose little girls are being murdered, whose leaders are being shot down in broad daylight!” And America still had “the audacity or the nerve to stand up and represent himself as the leader of the free world… with the blood of your and mine mothers and fathers on his hands—with the blood dripping down his jaws like a bloody-jawed wolf.”</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
