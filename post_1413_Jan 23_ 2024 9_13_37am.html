But this title isn't too far off. <br/> <br/> Republicans in Kentucky are putting forward a law that will be voted on this week called the “Safer Kentucky Act,” or HB5. <br/> <br/> The bill says the use of force is “justifiable” if a defendant believes that criminal trespass, robbery or “unlawful camping” is occurring on their property.   <br/> <br/> In addition, it says that “deadly physical force” is justifiable if a defendant believes that someone is trying to “dispossess” them of their property or is attempting a robbery or committing arson, language that could also have ramifications for tenants overstaying their lease.<br/> <br/> So, if you REALLY hate homeless people on your property you could certainly beat them and maybe even kill them. <br/> <br/> It's an interesting idea. That way the state doesn't have to be the bad guy. They are just supporting property rights. <br/> <br/> And then this fits beautifully into the playbook of keeping us fighting each other. <br/> <br/> I mean, you know they love that some Black people and their supporters hate cops, right? Just fight the cops and leave the powerful elite alone. It's so genius. <br/> <br/> It's why Republicans and Democrats hate each other. It's why Christians and humanitarians hate each other. It's why every race hates every other race (and if you don't think you're contributing to that issue just look around at who you actually live next to and work with.)<br/> <br/> Just let us eat ourselves. And then they can fight their stupid wars and funnel as much money as humanly possible to their corporate rich friends that keep them in power. <br/> <br/> It's also so smart to not actually provide any space for homeless people. Don't give them places to park their cars to sleep or allow them to put a tent anywhere. Then they are forced to take shelter on private property. And with any luck that property owner will be some irate white man who will find great pleasure beating the crap out of homeless people so the state doesn't have to do it.<br/> <br/> THIS IS THE PLAN, PEOPLE. Keep us hating each other and barely able to pay our bills. Then we'll all be too busy to turn our attention to the REAL problem: THEM.</div><div></div></div>
