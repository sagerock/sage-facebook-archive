            <div class="_2pin"><div>EDIT 3/9/2023: I just spoke to the head of Akron's Housing Compliance Division, Duane Groeger. He said they got the wrong house. 85 Kent Court is condemned and is being demolished. Our house, 85 Kent Place is fine and has no infractions.<br/> <br/> ********************** Here's the original post on 3/8/2023:<br/> <br/> I just learned that the city condemned the house where we house recently homeless people. They just took the trash cans. I was told no one should be living in the house. Apparently it was condemned in January. I have no record of that. And also apparently the appeals time has passed. <br/> <br/> They are sending people to jail who live in condemned houses. <br/> <br/> They stole my tents. And now they stole my house. <br/> <br/> I feel like Iâ€™m living in a nightmare.</div><div></div></div>
