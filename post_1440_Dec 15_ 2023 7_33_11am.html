Police said a man walked up to the window and attempted to buy a single Black and Mild cigar when a dispute broke out over the condition of the money the man was attempting to give Alibrahim.

You can probably make the assumption that the young man was Black. Black and Milds are typically bought by Black men. And I just feel this kind of extreme frustration with life more often with young Black men than young White men. 

Some young Black men are so angry. It’s like they carry the weight of 400 years of oppression on their shoulders. They are not going to take one more slight ever again. 

This murderer had money. But his money wasn’t good enough. That was it. Game over. 

Ahmad was killed for the endless brick walls this man undoubtedly experienced. 

It wasn’t Ahmad’s fault. He was just the poor soul standing in front of the murderer that couldn’t take one more wrong. 

Of course, the fault lies with wealthy capitalists that first made his ancestors slaves. And then when they were freed they threw his family in jail and gave all the jobs to Mexicans and Chinese people so he couldn’t get a good job even if he could get out of jail. 

But watch… some White man is going to jump in the comments and blame the entire Black community for having poor family values. We do nothing except put up road blocks for young Black men and then blame them for being lazy and valueless. 

Akron is a mean city. The people on the streets are no joke. Most of that has to do with Akron being a fundamentally racist city and now a classist city. Poor people are ignored and condemned in Akron. There is a lot to unwind in this city. Until then, innocent people like Ahmad are going to pay the price.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
