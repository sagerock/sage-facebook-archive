            <div class="_2pin"><div>I had a wonderful opportunity today to talk with an Akron Police Department officer about homelessness. I didn't ask him permission if I could mention his name. So I won't.<br/> <br/> But what I can tell you is that he works with groups like CSS and others to assist homeless people in getting help.  If he sees this maybe he could describe what he does better.<br/> <br/> But he came to our camp to listen to the people that live there. <br/> <br/> Rightfully, he says that a major issue is housing. We simply don't have enough of it.<br/> <br/> And then we have the issue of homeless people that aren't ready for the process of working the system. <br/> <br/> I also don't know if I have permission to talk about this, BUT there is a new 12 bed low barrier co-ed shelter in town. The deal is that you come 5 nights a week and in a month they help you with housing (I think that's correct. Again, if someone want to correct that please do so.)<br/> <br/> THIS IS HARD. <br/> <br/> I am terrible at working the system. I also have a natural aversion to authority. It's one of the reasons I get along so well with homeless people. I deeply get their passionate desire to be free. <br/> <br/> And I would say that there is probably some struggle on the other side with being open-minded to people who seemingly don't want to follow the rules. <br/> <br/> THIS IS HARD. <br/> <br/> But I am deeply, deeply thankful people are willing to walk into this hard space. And I hope they can be patient with me. I am passionate and I am like a mother bear to my homeless friends. <br/> <br/> I DESPERATELY WANT TO WORK WITH ANYONE THAT WANTS TO CONSIDER THIS SPACE.<br/> <br/> I don't want anyone to think I have all the answers or maybe any of the answers. But I know one thing for sure: Leaving American citizens to rot on the streets of our country is not the answer. It's unfair to them and it's unfair to the rest of society for the disease and trash and crime it leads to.</div><div></div></div>
