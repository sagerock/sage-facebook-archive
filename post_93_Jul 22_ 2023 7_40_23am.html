Apparently he had moved to Wooster and had cancer. He died July 5, 2023. He was 53. 

Ivan lived in a tent on my property for some time. He had quite a setup. He had run electricity to the tent and had it all decked out with white Christmas lights. He had a lot of stuff. I never could tell what was his and what was Michelle’s. She lived right next to him. Michelle is a hoarder and I think he was too. 

It was widely known that Ivan hurt women. I’m not totally clear exactly what he did. He may have raped them. I know he definitely touched them inappropriately. 

I once watched a woman spend nearly an hour trying to find a vein in Ivan’s arm to inject some drug. Meth, I think. He had terrible veins to be an injection drug user. 

He didn’t help around the camp much. He was pretty lazy. And he was unwilling to leave. When the city sued me for having tents on my property we bought him another tent and moved him to a camp behind the gay bath house behind the Battered Women’s Shelter. I was glad to have him off my property. 

He was one of these people that I tried to get these women to call the police on for attacking them. 

I’ve never had any luck getting women to call the police on their attackers. The general belief is that it will be worse for them if they do. They are always threatened that the man will kill them when they get out. Or he’ll have his friends kill them while he’s in. It’s not a bluff. That’s the world these women live in. 

I enjoyed talking with Ivan. That’s about all I can think to say.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
