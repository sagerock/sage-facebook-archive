It is SO delicious. 

My friend, Josh, pictured in back, got it for me. Josh and I have developed a really good friendship over the years. 

He has not lived in a traditional house for quite a few years. But he is doing really well. 

His brother, Jay, just died, probably from an overdose. His other brother is in prison. But Josh is making his way. 

He uses my truck to run scrap to the scrapyard a couple times a week. He has been mowing the lawn at my building with one of those manual push mowers. I hire him for random jobs. He’s cementing the new floor drain we installed in this bathroom. 

I’m really proud of Josh. 

He doesn’t live in an overpriced, drab apartment like the system wants him to. But he has a home. And he has lived in it for years rent free. Who are we to say that’s wrong?</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
