Was Jesus caring for lepers (people who were deemed "unclean" and considered cursed from God because of profound impurity) just something only a God is allowed to do?<br/> <br/> WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?? <br/> <br/> Whose right? <br/> Jesus? Or The Inspector? <br/> <br/> Because our Catholic mayor sure as hell seems to be on the side of The Inspector.</div><div></div></div>
