COME TO THE GOOD FRIDAY FOOD DRIVE AT ACME.

Celebrate Good Friday By Donating Some Food To Akron’s Homeless People

I’m hosting a food drive for Akron homeless people on Good Friday.

Where: Acme Parking Lot: 1835 W Market St, Akron, OH 44313

When: Good Friday: April 7, 2023 from 2-5pm. (Now 2pm-6pm).

What: Pop top canned food, bottled water, granola bars, anything that will hold up for several days outside.

Every Christmas Eve I spend the night outside in a tent. I do this to raise awareness of all the homeless pregnant women in Akron and around the world.

This year I’d like to add a second annual tradition: The Good Friday Food Drive For Akron Homeless People.

I am a Christian for one reason: Matthew 25:45:
“He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’

That belief is the driving force of everything I have ever done for our homeless neighbors.

Acme gave me permission to do this in their parking lot. I am excited to do this there because you could just run in and get a few things to donate.

Here are some ideas of things you could get:

Canned soups with those new pop-tops are great. Homeless people will often just pop the top and eat it cold right out of the can.

Granola bars are great.

Water is great (but they like all kinds of beverages. Just not diet. They don't like fake sugar.)

Anything that is instantly eatable that also would stand up in the rain for a week or more is great.

Chips are yummy.

Also keep in mind that many people don't have teeth. So, hard-to-chew things are difficult. I don't see a lot of beef jerky being eaten, for example.

Oh! Those Vienna Sausages in a can are a huge hit.

We make coffee a few days a week. So canned coffee, powdered creamer and sugar is always really appreciated.

Toilet paper and hand sanitizer is super handy.

You might consider making this a little family event. Please invite your kids. Everyone that comes will get an Easter Egg Surprise. Kids are also great at knowing what kind of food to get. If your kid says to get the food, chances are you should just get it. They know what’s good.

I hope to see you on Friday, April 7, 2023 from 2-5pm.

HAPPY GOOD FRIDAY!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
