            <div class="_2pin"><div>There was a warrant sweep this afternoon at the Church of the Nomadic Spirit tent village. What that means is they went through the camp and asked everybody for identification. They said all warrants were going. <br/> <br/> They took away 14 people. <br/> <br/> I talked to numerous people here and they all said that the police were respectful and professional.<br/> <br/>  I have always encouraged people to face their￼ legal issues. They are just terrified at the idea, however. Almost every single time someone comes back to our village from jail they tell me that they are very glad to get that off of the record.<br/> <br/> I want to thank the Akron Police Department for being professional and courteous to the residence of our tent village.￼<br/> <br/> We are going to wrap the tents of the people that have been taken away with plastic shipping wrap. We will do everything in our power to make sure that their things are not stolen. This is always an issue when somebody goes to jail.<br/> <br/> And they will be welcome back here when they come out of jail.￼</div><div></div></div>
