This is a man who was living very peacefully on my land. The city has sued me to not shelter people like Jeff. In an effort to be a good partner with the city I closed my camp￼. 

Jeff moved elsewhere. Within two days the city stole his brand new tent and stole all of his belongings.￼

I don’t care where Jeff lives. You just have to tell me where to move him.

The law has endless supporters and advocates. Land has endless supporters and advocates. Jeff has no one except me.￼￼</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
