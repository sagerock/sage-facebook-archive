            <div class="_2pin"><div>I can’t stop thinking about the families of the cops who killed #JaylandWalker<br/> <br/> I heard these were newer police. Only on the force for a few years. <br/> <br/> And then I think of their young, beautiful families. Probably wholesome. The kind of family that gets dressed up to go to church on Sundays. <br/> <br/> I’m sure they were so proud of their daddy or mommy doing such brave good work. And now this. <br/> <br/> They must be so scared and so sad right now.<br/> <br/> No one empties a clip in 6 seconds because they are evil. That happens because of adrenaline, fear and the poison of group think. They just did what everyone else was doing. <br/> <br/> I am NOT saying they shouldn’t be charged. I believe a jury of their peers needs to hear this case and do what they think is appropriate. <br/> <br/> What I AM saying is what I say a lot. The only way to get over this current hump in America is through compassion and understanding. We don’t have to condone the act. But we have to understand it. <br/> <br/> We have been doing eye for an eye vengeance for thousands of years. It’s gotten us this far in society. Which is pretty good, honestly. But if we want to get over the goal line we must learn and practice compassion and understanding.</div><div></div></div>
