My son, Indiana (pictured here with his girlfriend, Emily) are standing in front of Hokusai’s most famous piece. He is the one who drove this trip. He’s a big Hokusai fan. 

I am obsessed with this particular painting. It represents the world to me. It’s a story of some humans clinging for dear life as the most ominous and terrifying wave is bearing down on them. It looks hopeless. 

Yet Mount Fugi is a small, yet very clear representation of hope in the background. 

In my painting I don’t currently have a symbol of hope. I think compassion and hope and love are not what humanity represents. Collectively we are a careless and cruel swarm of mindless locusts.  

But Hokusai says there is hope. And so I take him as a prophet. Maybe there is hope even though I have ventured deep into the depths of human truth and I can see no hope whatsoever in the collective human consciousness.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Boston-Massachusetts/106003956105810" target="_blank">Boston, Massachusetts</a> (42.3577, -71.0565)</div><div>Address: Boston, MA</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
