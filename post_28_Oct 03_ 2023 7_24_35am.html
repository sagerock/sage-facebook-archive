We must call this what it is: this is the US government attacking its own people. This is class cleansing. 

We gave away all our jobs to Mexico and China, now Joe Biden has given 400,000 Venezuelans protected status to take more of our jobs. 

WHERE IS THE PROTECTED STATUS FOR OUR AMERICANS WHO HAVE LOST EVERYTHING?

Democrats and Republicans in western states are trying to convince the Supreme Court to allow them to reenact the policies of sweeping homeless camps while offering nowhere else to go. 

Houseless brothers and sisters: the time to stand up is now!

You are the new Native Americans who are being attacked through passive extermination. They know letting you suffer alone on the streets takes decades off your life. So repeatedly stealing your belongings and forcing you to move to nowhere is a death sentence. Every camp sweep takes years off your life. 

STAND UP, DAMNIT! 

Demand a safe place to live. 
Demand running water. 
Demand access to electricity. 
Demand access to toilets. 
Demand access to trash service. 

You have been neglected, spit on and blamed for the American policies that have put you where you are today. We didn’t have countless Americans living in tents when we had good, reliable jobs in this country. This is not your fault. This is ALL the fault of government policies that gave your jobs to the lowest bidders. And they are still doing it. 

Tell them what you want. And show them what will happen when you don’t get it.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
