            <div class="_2pin"><div>I have a homeless woman that has come to us for shelter. <br/> <br/> She was severely beaten by her boyfriend.<br/> <br/> Her friends live with us. She feels safe in our space.<br/> <br/> She has absolutely nothing. No tent. No blankets.  No clothes. No hygiene products. No shoes. Literally nothing.<br/> <br/> She wears size 9 1/2 shoes. Jeans size 10. Size large shirts. Size medium leggings.<br/> <br/> If you are able, could you help us with any of these items?<br/> <br/> Thank you for all that you do. I'm forever indebted to your incredible generosity.</div><div></div></div>
