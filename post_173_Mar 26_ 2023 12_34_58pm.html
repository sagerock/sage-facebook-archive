Here’s one:

This is my (homeless) friend, Jeff, with a dog he found scared and stuck on a train bridge. Jeff was walking across this train trestle this morning. 

This dog (Roxy) was too scared for him to help her. So Jeff went to the local fire station and got a blanket to pick her up so she wouldn’t bite him. 

I came over to hang out with my homeless friends which is something I do every Sunday. 

Jeff came to me and told me to post this pup’s picture to see if anyone was missing her. 

A friend of mine on Facebook, @[1179235134:2048:Laura Cogar Lawson], 
had seen Roxy’s owner had posted a missing dog post. 

The owner reached out to me. And Roxy and her owner were reunited. I’ll post that picture if that reuniting in the comments. 

Happy Sunday.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
