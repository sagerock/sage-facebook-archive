He got a bike that was part of a collection of bikes donated by Tim and Jen Vereb. 

Emo once pulled a woman out of a burning house. The stairs were crumbling beneath his feet. He showed me the burns on his back. The woman he rescued truly felt like Emo saved her life. 

He spent a little time in jail recently. I felt like the time away did him good. He seems a little calmer. A little happier. 

Emo is a hard worker. He is a scrapper. I would love to someday get a truck for the men and women who like to scrap. But that’s not on my shortlist. 

This month I’m going to attempt to get an occupancy permit for a part of my building to use as a bicycle repair shop. Bicycles are a major tool that take homeless people’s lives to the next level. 

Thank you to the Vereb’s for donating these bikes. People LOVE them.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>Place: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron-Ohio/104114042957938" target="_blank">Akron, Ohio</a> (41.0732, -81.5179)</div><div>Address: Akron, OH 44301</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
