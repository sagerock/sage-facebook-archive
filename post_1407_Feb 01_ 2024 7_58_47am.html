A homeless person gave me this flag to put up in our center. 

They don't hold any ill will against their country. (I have a much less forgiving attitude about it all.)

They also aren't anti-cop, no matter how many times they or their friends end up in jail for possession of a tiny amount of drugs.

Most homeless people are peaceful and mild-mannered. (Although many of them are also scavengers. So theft is a common issue. They remind me of raccoons. Smart, crafty, clever, but prefer to keep out of the way.) 

Dangerous homeless people are usually seriously mentally ill. Violent drug dealers might look homeless, but they really aren't. They are just exploiting and selling to the homeless community.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
