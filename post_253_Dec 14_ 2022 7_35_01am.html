But at the top of my daily task list I have written this:<br/> <br/> 2022: I will work on staying focused on the overwhelming goodness I see in you everyday and worry less about the system that uses us and abuses us for it's own benefit.<br/> <br/> The people are the face of God to me. You are all just so beautiful and kind and generous and giving. And you ask for so little in return.<br/> <br/> I love you.</div><div></div></div>
