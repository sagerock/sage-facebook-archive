            <div class="_2pin"><div>I signed a piece of paper yesterday agreeing to not shelter people in tents or any other structures (other than in our house) on 2 parcels of land owned by the Church of the Nomadic Spirit.<br/> <br/> This is a Temporary Injunction (I believe they called it). They are going to decide if they need to push this further based on "what I do this winter." <br/> <br/> The lawyers of the city of Akron said very explicitly that winter is coming and they want to see if I will shelter people on my land (or any land really).<br/> <br/> If I do they will continue to come back at me. If I put anyone on these 2 pieces of land I face fines and jail time.<br/> <br/> They want to see if I dare shelter anyone during this Northeast Ohio winter.<br/> <br/> I told them I'm looking forward to seeing what I'll do as well.</div><div></div></div>
