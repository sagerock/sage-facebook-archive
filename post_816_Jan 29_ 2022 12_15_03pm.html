            <div class="_2pin"><div>I want to share this moving email I got about the Emergency Shelter in Akron. It is growing really well. (My hope is that it becomes a permanent emergency shelter that is open year round, or at least all winter). They had their first child EVER last night:<br/> <br/> First things first...<br/> Per previous correspondences, the Emergency Overnight Shelter will be open tonight,<br/> Friday Night 1/28/2022<br/> Saturday Night 1/29/2022 and <br/> Sunday Night 1/30/2022<br/> <br/> Since the weather will moderate and give us a brief respite, the EOS will not open and will be closed on Monday Night 1/31, Tuesday Night 2/1 and Wednesday Night 2/2. (This does not pertain to the Transitional Overnight Shelter which will remain open.) On Sunday or Monday we will evaluate the weather situation and determine when the EOS will be open next; (it looks like later next week).<br/> <br/> For your information, a year ago, this date, January 28th, was our first night open. This season, the EOS has been open 21 nights so far. To date, there have been 144 different folks stay with us at least one night. We have hosted 635 overnight stays so far this season.<br/> <br/> I want to share two items with you all. It is good we are here.<br/> Last night, at about 10:30 PM, we received our first ever child ! (The Peter Maurin Center has been hosting the Emergency Overnight Shelter for vulnerable folks for roughly ten years and never hosted a child previously.) Long- story-short, The Akron Police Department brought a woman and a three year old little girl to the EOS that were in harm's way. The woman was very distraught but spent a safe night with us. This morning, CSS was contacted early on about the situation. Access was contacted and found a space for the woman and child. Thank you Chris, Michael and Jackie for the quick work your team's do to protect vulnerable folks like this. This is simply another reason we are here !<br/> <br/> Second, I want to share a note recently received from a CSS Receptionist. Kudos to Tom Smith of PMC... He prepared this particular meal. His culinary skills are apparent every time we open the doors at 1096 Old S. Main.<br/> <br/> Thanks to everyone for all you do. Please forward this information to all that might be interested.<br/> <br/> David Churbock<br/> The Peter Maurin Center<br/> 330-328-3199<br/> <br/> "Subject: Compliment for Homeless Outreach<br/> <br/> I was speaking with a client this morning, Nathan, who stayed last night at the Homeless Outreach on Voris Street. Nathan could not stop praising the facility and the staff.<br/> <br/> He stressed that he was treated with respect from everyone there including the security officer. They treated his (and everyone's) belongings with respect. Nathan could not stop talking about the food they were given too. Ham, scalloped potatoes, green beans, coffee, hot chocolate, juice. Then dessert and also FRESH fruit. He said the fruit must have come right off the truck because it was fresh!<br/> <br/> Nathan described the layout to me and said everything was so clean and nice. The hospitality was exceptional!!! Everyone got along - even with only one bathroom. <br/> <br/> **I just wanted everyone to know about the TERRIFIC job that Homeless Outreach is doing during this COLD difficult time and what our client(s) think of the facility. <br/> <br/> Maybe someone can pass this on to the Administrative staff and Mr. Stokes so they can know the GREAT job CSS/Homeless Outreach is doing?<br/> <br/> Thank you everyone!!!!"</div><div></div></div>
