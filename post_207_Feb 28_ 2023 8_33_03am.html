One job of historic, profound importance DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH and you just failed miserably.

We can put the blame on Jeff Fusco all we want. Yes. He's a racist jerk that carries the water for the mayor. BUT YOU KNOW THAT! That's how this all works. You work with people that you don't like because the people elected them. 

You needed to get 8 people across the line for the first round of the police oversight board and you couldn't do it.

You ALL deserve this scorn. You embarrass me. You embarrass every Black family in Akron and you embarrass the nation.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
