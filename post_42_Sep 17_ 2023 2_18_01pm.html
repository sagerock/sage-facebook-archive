This is @[100002772477566:2048:Harry Patterson Jr.] from @[100065044142009:2048:Friends in Tents FIT and Community Outreach]. 

Crystal has been living on a bench FOR MONTHS at my place. I suspect she is 7-8 months pregnant. I saw her today. She looked tired and pretty beat up. 

Harry has been keeping an eye on Crystal. He came today WITH A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL and was taking Crystal to the ER. It’s a huge thing because I had asked Crystal an hour earlier if she wanted to go to the hospital. She said no. 

@[100061412281743:2048:Josh Imler] came too to help. I would not doubt that his presence helped inspire her to go. 

This is how homeless outreach is done. It’s not done by the organizations that get millions of dollars a year from the government. It’s done by little upstarts that have little to nothing in financial support. And certainly nothing from the government. 

Thank you Harry, Josh and Friends in Tents. You are incredible!</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
