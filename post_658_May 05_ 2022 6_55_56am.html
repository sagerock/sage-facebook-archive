            <div class="_2pin"><div>A Black man celebrates women's loss of bodily autonomy (possibly the most ironic of them all). An LGBTQIA person celebrates the physical attack of a Black comedian. A White woman celebrates getting tough on all those no-good drug addicts. <br/> <br/> Meanwhile us middle-class and above white men sit on the sidelines slurping up our buffalo wings and cheesey fries watching with great amusement as you do all the hard work for us. We don't have to ever worry about losing power because you destroy each other just fine on your own.</div><div></div></div>
