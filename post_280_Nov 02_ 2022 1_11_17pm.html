The Red icons are the 2019 May Primary voters I will be getting to. 

If you are in Ward 8 in Akron, look for me on my electric bicycle. I'll be coming to a neighborhood near you. 

I'm running for Ward 8 City Council in Akron Ohio. I am VERY serious about winning this thing. I truly believe we could be on the cusp of a much better Akron where the politicians listen to the people and not the corporations. 

In May 2023 
Vote: Sage Lewis Ward 8
Shammas Malik for Mayor.
I don't know if Nancy Holland in Ward 1 will have to run again. She's up for election right now. You should vote for her. 

As long as they run again, you should vote for:
Tara Mosley Ward 5
Russel C. Neal Ward 4
Linda Omobien At Large.

Jeff Fusco is Satan and he should never be given another job in politics ever again. I wouldn't trust him to not poison the fries at McDonald's.

Donnie Kammer is growing on me. He supports animals. And he voiced is opposition to Fusco's hateful resolution against Issue 10.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
