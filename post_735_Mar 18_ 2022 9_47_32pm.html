            <div class="_2pin"><div>A couple was brought to me by Ministry in Motion F.I.T-Friends in Tents <br/> They had been evicted this morning with absolutely nowhere to go. They never had lived in a tent before. The woman, particularly, looked nervous. I've seen the look before. It's a look of like waking up to a nightmare you never imagined possible. <br/> <br/> Meanwhile, the Akron budget meetings are going on now. They discussed evictions this week. The belief is that we are going to be back to pre-pandemic levels which amounts to 10 evictions every single day. That's over 3800 evictions a year. <br/> <br/> Akron is number 1 in evictions in Ohio.</div><div></div></div>
