We MUST take swift action when someone with a mental illness is making moves to hurt other people. 

I have a gay Black man I am sheltering with extreme mental illness. About 3 days ago he nearly threw a rock through my truck window. 

I have been threatened by him repeatedly. Once with a sledgehammer.  Once with an ax. Once with a 2x4. 

Yesterday a man put a gun to his face and pulled the trigger. The gun didn’t fire. 

He may seriously hurt someone some day. But more likely he’s going to end up dead. 

This latest gunman should have been actively detained and evaluated WAY before yesterday.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
