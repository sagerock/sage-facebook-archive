            <div class="_2pin"><div>I just want to take a second to thank you.<br/> <br/> We've been having a really hard time with getting our water bill under control at the house where we shelter a few homeless people in dire need. <br/> <br/> We have one renter who pays. I'm so thankful for him. <br/> <br/> But then all other money comes from you. We have $1529.10 in our bank account. The full amount of our water bill is: $770.98. <br/> <br/> I WAS ABLE TO PAY IT OFF IN FULL. <br/> <br/> The last couple months have had a real "lost in the desert" feel for me. Running for city council is a wild emotional ride. And this house is incredibly challenging right now.<br/> <br/> For example, I shelter some homeless sex workers. So, guess what the police are talking to me about at the house? Sex work.<br/> <br/> I am sheltering a woman who is repeatedly seriously beaten by her boyfriend. 2 days after the last extreme beating I saw them together again in the house. <br/> <br/> They have found a ton of copper in an abandoned building. So they bring it to my place and burn off the plastic coating. Then the neighbors call the police and complain about the terrible black smoke.<br/> <br/> It goes on and on. <br/> <br/> Truthfully, I don't mind being in this lost kind of place. It's where you often find your own truth. But that doesn't make it any easier.<br/> <br/> But all the while: there you are. There you are with your love and hope and generosity. I had a girlfriend in college who would bite me SO hard on the neck. And then she'd gently kiss it. My life feels like that right at the moment. Pain and comfort. It's bizarre.<br/> <br/> Thank you so much for everything. I am so grateful for you.</div><div></div></div>
