        <div class="post-content">
            <div class="_2pin"><div>I’m pleased that the court system of Memphis was able to bring justice to Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was brutally beaten and murdered by 5 police officers. They all are charged with 2nd degree murder. <br/> <br/> The added twist here is that all 5 officers are Black. <br/> <br/> So the idea that changing the color of police officers is clearly not the answer. <br/> <br/> People are justified in being enraged and furious that these are supposed to be people that protect and serve. But you never know when you’re going to run into a gang of police officers that is there to torture and murder. <br/> <br/> I liken it to pedophile church leaders. Both professions cater to a certain kind of person that sometimes ends up abusing their power. <br/> <br/> Maybe more harsh sentences for criminal cops would help. <br/> <br/> I’d like to see the end of qualified immunity. And I would like police officers to be able to be subjected to civil lawsuits like doctors. <br/> <br/> Maybe those things would help. But we can’t ignore this like we do school shootings and homelessness and addiction. This issue destroys the social contract we all have agreed to live by. This will continue to tear America apart. Divided we fall. <br/> <br/> That’s how America dies.</div><div></div></div>
